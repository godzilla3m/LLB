## Q1. Describe the constitution and sub-ordination of Criminal Courts. What are the provisions about it in Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023? Discuss.

**Introduction**

The administration of criminal justice in India is carried out through a well-defined hierarchy of courts. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, which replaced the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), maintains the core structure of the criminal judiciary while introducing updates to streamline functions. The "Constitution of Criminal Courts" refers to the establishment and types of courts, while "Subordination" refers to the vertical relationship of authority between these courts.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Classes of Criminal Courts (Section 6\)** Under Section 6 of the BNSS, besides the High Courts and the Supreme Court (which are governed by the Constitution), there shall be the following classes of Criminal Courts in every State:

* **Courts of Session:** The highest criminal court in a district.  
* **Judicial Magistrates of the First Class:** Handle moderately serious offenses.  
* **Judicial Magistrates of the Second Class:** Handle less serious offenses.  
* **Executive Magistrates:** Focus more on administrative and preventive measures (like maintaining public order).

**2\. Territorial Divisions and Establishment (Sections 7-10)** The State is divided into sessions divisions. Each division has a **Court of Session (Section 8\)** established by the State Government, presided over by a Judge appointed by the High Court.

* **Example:** **Prateek** lives in **Indore**, which is a sessions division. If a serious crime occurs there, the case will be heard by the Sessions Judge appointed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court.

**3\. Judicial Magistrates (Sections 11-14)** In every district, the State Government establishes Courts of Judicial Magistrates. The **Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM)** is appointed for each district to oversee the work of other Magistrates.

* **Example:** **Krishna** is a JMIC (Judicial Magistrate First Class) in **Lucknow**. He is subordinate to the CJM, **Saurabh**, who manages the distribution of cases among all Magistrates in the district.

**4\. Executive Magistrates (Section 14\)** In every district, the State Government appoints **Executive Magistrates**, one of whom is designated as the **District Magistrate (DM)**.

* **Example:** **Raghavendra** is the DM of **Varanasi**. He works alongside Sub-divisional Magistrates like **Satyam** to ensure public peace. A new provision in BNSS (Section 15\) allows the appointment of certain police officers (not below SP rank) as **Special Executive Magistrates**.

**5\. Subordination of Courts (Sections 15 & 23\)** Subordination ensures accountability and a clear path for appeals:

* All Judicial Magistrates are subordinate to the CJM.  
* The CJM and all Additional Sessions Judges are subordinate to the Sessions Judge.  
* Executive Magistrates (like **Satyam**) are subordinate to the District Magistrate (**Raghavendra**).

---

**Conclusion**

The BNSS 2023 ensures that the judicial system remains accessible and structured. By clearly defining the roles from the Sessions Judge down to the Magistrate of the Second Class, the law prevents jurisdictional chaos. The subordination of courts allows for a supervisory mechanism where higher courts can correct the legal errors of lower courts through revisions and appeals, ensuring that citizens like **Laukendra** or **Kanishth** receive a fair and standardized trial regardless of where they are in India.

---

## Q2. What is the procedure of arrest and what are the duties of the arresting officer under the Section 36 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha, 2023 ? State whether a police officer can arrest the person who complies with the terms of the notice under 35 (3) to (6).

**Introduction**

The power of arrest is one of the most significant powers granted to the police, as it directly curtails the fundamental right to personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. To prevent the misuse of this power, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** provides strict procedural safeguards. While Section 35 deals with when a police officer may arrest without a warrant, **Section 36** (formerly Section 41B of the CrPC) specifically outlines the mandatory procedure and duties of the arresting officer to ensure transparency and accountability.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Procedure and Duties under Section 36** Section 36 of the BNSS mandates that every police officer making an arrest must follow a standardized protocol:

* **Visible Identification:** The officer must bear accurate, visible, and clear identification of their name and designation to facilitate easy identification by the citizen.  
* **Preparation of Arrest Memorandum:** The officer must prepare a "Memorandum of Arrest" at the time of the arrest. This document is the primary evidence of the arrest's legality.  
* **Attestation by Witnesses:** The memorandum must be attested by at least one witness. This witness can be a member of the family of the person arrested or a "respectable member of the locality" where the arrest is made.  
  * *Example:* **Laukendra**, a police officer in **Jaipur**, arrests **Saurabh** for a theft investigation. **Laukendra** must prepare a memo and have it signed by **Saurabh**’s brother, **Satyam**, or a local shopkeeper.  
* **Countersignature:** The memorandum must be countersigned by the person arrested.  
* **Informing Rights:** If the memorandum is not attested by a family member, the officer must inform the arrested person that they have a right to have a relative or friend informed of their arrest and the place of detention.  
  * *Example:* When **Sachkeerat** is arrested in **Amritsar**, Officer **Raghavendra** must tell him, "You have the right to call your friend **Prateek** and inform him where you are being taken."

**2\. Notice of Appearance (Section 35(3) to 35(6))** The BNSS emphasizes "arrest as a last resort," especially for offenses punishable by less than seven years. Under Section 35(3), the police *shall* issue a notice of appearance rather than arresting the person immediately if an arrest is not strictly required.

* **Section 35(4):** It is the duty of the person (the noticee) to comply with the terms of the notice.  
* **Section 35(5) \- Arrest after Compliance:** The law provides a protective shield to those who cooperate. If the person complies and continues to comply with the notice, they **shall not be arrested** in respect of that offense.  
* **Exception:** A police officer **can still arrest** a complying person, but only if they record reasons in writing. The officer must be of the opinion that for proper investigation or to prevent tampering with evidence, the arrest is absolutely necessary.  
  * *Example:* **Kanishth** receives a notice to appear at a police station in **Bhopal**. He attends every day and answers questions. Officer **Krishna** cannot arrest him unless **Krishna** writes in the case diary: "I am arresting **Kanishth** because I found he is planning to flee to **Indore** to destroy the original forged documents."  
* **Section 35(6) \- Non-compliance:** If the person fails to comply or refuses to identify themselves, the police may arrest them immediately.

---

**Conclusion**

Section 36 of the BNSS acts as a vital check on police "high-handedness" by mandating documentation and witness involvement. Regarding the notice under Section 35, the legislative intent is clear: cooperation should be rewarded with freedom. A person who complies with the notice generally cannot be arrested. However, the law provides a narrow window for arrest in exceptional circumstances, provided the officer records the specific necessity in writing. This ensures that the arrest is an "individualized" act of justice rather than a mechanical routine, as recently upheld by various High Courts in 2025\.

## Q3. Who can claim maintenance under Section 144 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 ? No wife shall be entitled to receive maintenance from her husband without any sufficient reason if she refuses to live with her husband or they are living separately by mutual consent. Discuss.

**Introduction**

Section 144 of the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, which corresponds to the erstwhile Section 125 of the CrPC, is a secular and social-welfare provision. Its primary objective is to prevent "vagrancy and destitution" by providing a summary legal remedy for financial support. It enforces the moral and legal obligation of a person with sufficient means to support their dependent family members who are unable to maintain themselves.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Who can claim maintenance? (Section 144(1))** Under Section 144(1), if a person has sufficient means but neglects or refuses to maintain the following dependents, a Magistrate of the First Class can order monthly maintenance:

* **The Wife:** A wife who is unable to maintain herself. The term "wife" includes a woman who has been divorced and has not remarried.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** and his wife **Anjali** are separated in **Indore**. If **Anjali** is unable to support herself, she can claim maintenance from **Prateek**.  
* **Legitimate or Illegitimate Children:**  
  * **Minor Children:** Whether married or not, who cannot maintain themselves.  
  * **Major Children:** If they have reached majority but are unable to maintain themselves due to physical or mental abnormality or injury (excluding married daughters).  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh** in **Bhopal** must maintain his 10-year-old son **Kanishth**, even if **Kanishth** was born out of wedlock.  
* **Father or Mother:** Parents who are unable to maintain themselves. This duty extends to both sons and daughters.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna**, working in **Bangalore**, is legally bound to provide for his aged father **Raghavendra** who lives in **Varanasi** and has no source of income.

**2\. Grounds for Denial of Maintenance (Section 144(4))** The law provides specific circumstances under which a wife is **not** entitled to maintenance:

* **Adultery:** If she is living in adultery.  
* **Refusal to live together without sufficient reason:** If she refuses to live with her husband without a valid legal or personal justification.  
* **Mutual Consent:** If the couple is living separately by mutual agreement.  
  * *Example:* **Laukendra** and his wife decide to live separately in **Jaipur** to pursue independent careers and sign an agreement stating neither will claim support. In this case, the wife cannot later claim maintenance under Section 144\.

**3\. "Sufficient Reason" for Living Separately** The court does not blindly apply the rule of refusal. If a wife has a "just ground," she can live separately and still claim maintenance.

* **Husband's Misconduct:** Cruelty, desertion, or the husband contracting a second marriage/keeping a mistress are considered sufficient reasons.  
  * *Example:* **Satyam** marries another woman while still being married to **Priya** in **Patna**. If **Priya** refuses to live with **Satyam** because of this, the court will rule her refusal is "justified," and **Satyam** must still pay her maintenance.  
* **Standard of Living:** As established in recent 2025 rulings, "unable to maintain herself" does not mean the wife must be in absolute poverty; she is entitled to a standard of living similar to what she enjoyed at her husband's house.

---

**Conclusion**

Section 144 of the BNSS is a pillar of social justice that ensures vulnerable individuals—wives, children, and the elderly—are not left to starve. While it protects the right to maintenance, it also balances this with Section 144(4) to ensure the law is not misused. By requiring "sufficient reason" for living separately, the Sanhita encourages the preservation of the marital home while simultaneously protecting the dignity of a woman like **Priya** or **Anjali** who may be forced to live apart due to the husband's misconduct.

## Q4. Discuss the conditional order for removal of nuisance under Section 152 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 and the procedure adopted where disputes concerning land and water are likely to cause breach of peace.

**Introduction**

Maintaining public order and tranquility is a primary function of the Executive. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** empowers Executive Magistrates to take swift action against public nuisances and property disputes that could lead to violence. **Section 152** of the BNSS (corresponding to Section 133 of the old CrPC) provides a mechanism for the "conditional removal" of public nuisances, while **Section 164** (old Section 145\) outlines the procedure for resolving land and water disputes to prevent a breach of peace. These provisions are preventive and remedial, rather than punitive.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Conditional Order for Removal of Nuisance (Section 152\)** Section 152 allows a District Magistrate (DM), Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM), or specially empowered Executive Magistrate to intervene when a public nuisance is reported.

* **Grounds for Action:** The Magistrate may act if there is:  
  * An unlawful obstruction or nuisance in a public place, way, or river.  
  * A trade or occupation injurious to health or comfort.  
  * A dangerous building, tree, or structure likely to fall and cause injury.  
  * An unfenced tank, well, or excavation near a public way.  
* **The Conditional Nature:** The Magistrate does not pass a final order immediately. Instead, they issue a "conditional order" requiring the person to either remove the nuisance within a fixed time or appear in court to "show cause" why the order should not be made absolute.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh** runs a chemical unit in **Bhopal** that releases toxic fumes into a residential colony. **Prateek**, an SDM, issues a conditional order under Section 152 directing **Saurabh** to either install filters within 15 days or show cause why the unit should not be shut down.

**2\. Disputes Concerning Land or Water (Section 164\)** When a dispute over land or water is likely to cause a "breach of peace," the Executive Magistrate intervenes under Section 164\.

* **Initiation:** The Magistrate must be "satisfied" from a police report or other information that a dispute exists.  
* **The Preliminary Order:** The Magistrate makes a written order requiring the parties to attend court and put in written statements of their claims regarding "actual possession" of the property.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** and **Kanishth** are fighting over the boundaries of a farm in **Indore**. The local police report that both have gathered armed supporters. **Raghavendra**, the DM, issues an order under Section 164 for both to appear and prove who was in possession of the land.  
* **Inquiry into Possession:** The Magistrate’s role is **not** to decide who "owns" the land (title), but who was in "actual possession" at the time of the preliminary order. If a party was forcibly and wrongfully dispossessed within two months before the report, the Magistrate may treat them as if they were in possession.  
* **Final Order:** The Magistrate then declares the possessing party entitled to remain there until "evicted in due course of law" by a civil court.

**3\. Specific Categories (Section 164(2))** "Land or water" is defined broadly to include buildings, markets, fisheries, crops, and even the rents or profits derived from such property. \* *Example:* **Laukendra** and **Satyam** have a dispute over the fishing rights in a pond in **Varanasi**. Because this threatens local peace, the Magistrate applies the Section 164 procedure to decide who currently manages the pond.

---

**Conclusion**

Sections 152 and 164 of the BNSS serve as essential tools for the "preventive" administration of justice. Section 152 balances public health and safety with the right to be heard through its "conditional" approach. Meanwhile, Section 164 acts as a temporary "stop-gap" to prevent blood-shed over property, leaving the final determination of ownership to the Civil Courts. By focusing on "possession" rather than "title," the law ensures that citizens like **Sachkeerat** or **Kanishth** do not take the law into their own hands while waiting for a long civil trial, thereby preserving the public tranquility of cities like **Prayagraj** or **Jaipur**.

## Q5. What do you understand by the cognizance of an offence by a Magistrate? Discuss the procedure in detail.

**Introduction**

The term **"Cognizance"** is not explicitly defined in the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** or its predecessor, the CrPC. However, judicially, it means "taking judicial notice" of an offense. It is the crucial stage where the investigative process ends and the judicial process begins. It is the point at which a Magistrate decides that there is sufficient material on record to initiate proceedings against an accused person. **Section 210** of the BNSS (formerly Section 190 of the CrPC) outlines the powers of a Magistrate to take cognizance.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Meaning of Cognizance** Taking cognizance does not mean the start of a trial; it merely means the Magistrate has applied their "judicial mind" to the facts of the case to see if an offense has been committed. It is a condition precedent to the initiation of proceedings.

* **Example:** If **Satyam** files a report about a theft in **Varanasi**, the Magistrate **Prateek** "takes cognizance" the moment he reads the file and decides to call for witnesses or issue a summons.

**2\. Who can take Cognizance? (Section 210\)**

* Any **Magistrate of the First Class** can take cognizance of any offense.  
* A **Magistrate of the Second Class** can also do so if specially empowered by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM).  
* **Example:** **Saurabh**, a JMIC in **Bhopal**, is competent to take cognizance of a fraud case involving **Kanishth**.

**3\. Three Modes of Taking Cognizance (Section 210(1))** A Magistrate can take cognizance in three distinct ways:

* **(a) Upon a Complaint:** Receiving a written or oral allegation of facts that constitute an offense.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** goes directly to court in **Jaipur** and files a private complaint against **Raghavendra** for defamation.  
* **(b) Upon a Police Report:** After the police complete an investigation and file a "Charge Sheet" or "Final Report" under Section 193 (old Sec 173).  
  * *Example:* The **Lucknow** police submit a report stating that **Laukendra** was involved in a brawl. Magistrate **Sachkeerat** takes cognizance based on this report.  
* **(c) Upon Information/Sua Sponte:** Upon information from any person other than a police officer or the Magistrate’s own knowledge.

**4\. The Procedure: Post-Cognizance Steps** Once a Magistrate decides to take cognizance, the procedure depends on how the case reached them:

* **In Complaint Cases (Sections 223–226):**  
  * The Magistrate must examine the complainant (e.g., **Krishna**) and any witnesses on oath.  
  * **New Provision in BNSS:** A significant change in the BNSS (Proviso to Section 223\) is that the Magistrate **must** give the accused an opportunity of being heard before taking cognizance in certain cases, especially to prevent frivolous litigation.  
* **In Police Report Cases:**  
  * The Magistrate examines the "Case Diary" and the "Charge Sheet." If they find a *prima facie* case, they issue a "Process" (Summons or Warrant) to the accused under Section 227 to begin the trial.  
  * **Timeline:** Under the BNSS, the Magistrate must decide whether to take cognizance within **14 days** of receiving the charge sheet to ensure a speedy trial.

---

**Conclusion**

Cognizance is the "bridge" between investigation and trial. It acts as a safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by ensuring that no person is forced to stand trial unless a judicial officer like **Prateek** or **Saurabh** is satisfied that a crime has indeed occurred. The BNSS 2023 has modernized this stage by introducing strict timelines (14 days) and mandatory hearings for the accused in complaint cases, thereby balancing the rights of the victim with the protection of the innocent from malicious prosecution in cities like **Indore** or **Patna**.

## Q6. Discuss the laws relating to information in cognizable cases under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\. What new provisions have been inserted in this Sanhita and what is its evidentiary value ? Discuss.

**Introduction**

In the Indian criminal justice system, the First Information Report (FIR) is the document that sets the machinery of law into motion. While the term "FIR" is not explicitly defined in the law, it is embodied in the provisions relating to "Information in Cognizable Cases." Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, these provisions are contained in **Section 173**, which replaces the erstwhile Section 154 of the CrPC. A cognizable case is one where a police officer may arrest without a warrant. The BNSS has modernized this process by integrating technology and introducing mandatory timelines to ensure transparency and efficiency.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Laws Relating to Information (Section 173\)** Section 173 mandates that every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offense, if given to an officer in charge of a police station, must be recorded.

* **Oral Information:** If given orally, it must be reduced to writing, read over to the informant, and signed by them.  
* **Electronic Information (e-FIR):** Information can now be given by "electronic communication." However, to be officially recorded as an FIR, the informant must sign it within **three days**.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** witnesses a robbery in **Lucknow**. He sends an email to the local police station. For this to become a formal FIR, **Prateek** must visit the station or provide a digital signature within 72 hours.

**2\. New Provisions in BNSS** The BNSS has introduced several groundbreaking updates to the FIR process:

* **Zero FIR:** Section 173(1) now explicitly states that information can be given "irrespective of the area where the offense is committed." This codifies the "Zero FIR" concept, meaning a police station cannot refuse a complaint just because the crime happened elsewhere.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** is mugged in **Mumbai** but travels back to his home in **Nagpur**. He can file a Zero FIR in **Nagpur**, which will then be transferred to the relevant station in **Mumbai**.  
* **Preliminary Inquiry (Section 173(3)):** For offenses punishable by **3 to 7 years**, the police now have the discretion to conduct a preliminary inquiry to see if a *prima facie* case exists before registering an FIR. This must be done with the prior permission of an officer (not below DSP rank) and completed within **14 days**.  
  * *Example:* **Raghavendra** is accused of a complex financial fraud in **Indore**. Officer **Saurabh** (DSP) authorizes a 14-day inquiry to check the bank records before officially naming **Raghavendra** in an FIR.  
* **Videography:** For sexual offenses, the recording of the victim's information must be videographed to preserve the integrity of the statement.  
* **Progress Reports:** The police are now legally bound to inform the victim/informant of the progress of the investigation within **90 days**.

**3\. Evidentiary Value of Information** It is a settled principle that an FIR is **not substantive evidence**. This means a court cannot convict someone based *only* on what is written in the FIR because it is not made under oath and is not subject to cross-examination.

* **Corroboration:** It can be used under the **Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA)** to corroborate the testimony of the person who gave the information.  
* **Contradiction:** It can be used by the defense to contradict the informant if they change their story during the trial.  
  * *Example:* If **Kanishth** tells the police in **Bhopal** that he saw **Laukendra** with a knife, but in court says it was a gun, the defense will use the FIR to "contradict" his credibility.  
* **Exception (Dying Declaration):** If the informant dies after filing the FIR, the report can become substantive evidence as a "Dying Declaration."

---

**Conclusion**

The transition from Section 154 CrPC to Section 173 BNSS reflects a shift from "colonial control" to "citizen-centric justice." By codifying Zero FIR and e-FIR, the law ensures that geographical and technological barriers do not prevent a victim like **Satyam** or **Sachkeerat** from seeking justice. While the evidentiary value remains limited to corroboration and contradiction to prevent false implications, the new safeguards like mandatory videography and fixed timelines for preliminary inquiries bring a much-needed balance between the power of the police and the rights of the accused in modern India.

## Q7. Describe the procedure for search and seizure under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\.

**Introduction**

Search and seizure are essential investigative tools used by law enforcement to collect evidence, recover stolen property, or find persons wrongfully confined. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, these powers are balanced with procedural safeguards to protect the privacy and dignity of citizens. While the basic framework remains similar to the old CrPC (Sections 94–124 and 185), the BNSS introduces a revolutionary change: the **mandatory videography** of the entire process to ensure transparency and prevent the planting of evidence.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. General Principles of Search (Section 103\)** Section 103 (formerly Section 100 of CrPC) provides the "Gold Standard" for conducting a search. Whether it is a house, shop, or vehicle, the following rules apply:

* **Independence of Witnesses:** Before starting a search, the officer must call upon two or more independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality to attend and witness the search.  
* **Presence of the Occupant:** The occupant of the place or their representative must be allowed to attend the search.  
* **The Search List:** A list of all things seized (Seizure Memo) must be prepared and signed by the witnesses. A copy of this list must be delivered to the occupant.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh**, a police officer in **Bhopal**, conducts a search of **Kanishth**’s godown. He calls **Prateek** and **Krishna**, two local shopkeepers, to witness the process. Every item found is noted down, and **Kanishth** receives a signed copy of the list.

**2\. Mandatory Audio-Video Recording (Section 105\)** This is the most significant update in the BNSS. Section 105 mandates that the process of search and seizure, including the preparation of the seizure list and the signing by witnesses, **shall be recorded** through audio-video electronic means (preferably a mobile phone).

* **Forwarding to Magistrate:** The recording must be forwarded without delay to the District Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate, or Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.  
  * *Example:* While searching a suspect's house in **Indore**, Officer **Laukendra** uses his smartphone to record the discovery of a hidden locker. This video proves that the evidence was not planted and was found in the presence of witnesses **Satyam** and **Raghavendra**.

**3\. Search Without Warrant (Section 185\)** An Investigating Officer (IO) can search a place without a warrant if they have "reasonable grounds" to believe that a warrant cannot be obtained without the risk of the evidence being destroyed or concealed.

* **Recording Reasons:** The officer must record the grounds of their belief in the case diary before proceeding.  
* **48-Hour Rule:** Under Section 185(5), the IO must send copies of the record (reasons and search results) to the nearest Magistrate within **48 hours**.  
  * *Example:* **Sachkeerat**, a police officer in **Amritsar**, receives a tip that a suspect is about to burn forged documents. He cannot wait for a court warrant, so he records his reasons and searches the house immediately, ensuring the process is videographed.

**4\. Seizure of Property (Section 107\)** The BNSS expands the power to seize property. While the old law focused on movable property, **Section 107** now specifically includes **immovable property** that is suspected to be "proceeds of crime."

* **Example:** If the police find that a bungalow in **Lucknow** was bought using money from a large-scale scam, they can now move to attach/seize that immovable property during the investigation.

---

**Conclusion**

The procedure for search and seizure under the BNSS 2023 is designed to move away from the "police-heavy" approach of the past toward a "technology-driven" transparent system. By making videography mandatory under Section 105, the law protects officers from false allegations of corruption and protects citizens like **Kanishth** or **Satyam** from the "planting" of evidence. This digital trail ensures that the evidence presented in courts in **Jaipur** or **Varanasi** is credible, thereby strengthening the foundation of a fair trial.

## Q8. What is Investigation of Crime? How does it differ from inquiry? Discuss the main stages of the investigation as contained in the provisions of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\.

**Introduction**

The process of criminal justice begins the moment a crime is reported. The initial phase, where the police work to uncover the truth and collect evidence, is known as "Investigation." Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, investigation is the bedrock upon which a trial is built. It is an administrative process conducted primarily by the police to identify the offender and gather material to prove the case in court. While "Investigation" and "Inquiry" are often used interchangeably in common parlance, they are distinct legal terms under the BNSS with different objectives and authorities.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Meaning of Investigation and Inquiry**

* **Investigation \[Section 2(1)(l)\]:** It includes all proceedings for the **collection of evidence** conducted by a police officer or any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorized by a Magistrate in this behalf.  
* **Inquiry \[Section 2(1)(k)\]:** It means every inquiry, **other than a trial**, conducted under this Sanhita by a Magistrate or Court. Its purpose is to determine the truth or falsity of certain facts to decide if a trial should begin.

**2\. Key Differences** | Feature | Investigation | Inquiry | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | **Authority** | Conducted by Police or authorized person. | Conducted by a Magistrate or Court. | | **Objective** | To collect evidence. | To determine the truth/falsity of facts. | | **Nature** | Administrative/Non-judicial. | Judicial or Quasi-judicial. | | **Stage** | First stage (precedes inquiry). | Second stage (follows investigation). |

* *Example:* **Saurabh**, a police officer in **Bhopal**, collects blood samples from a crime scene. This is **Investigation**. When these facts are presented to Magistrate **Prateek**, he examines the witnesses to decide if there is a case. This is **Inquiry**.

**3\. Main Stages of Investigation under BNSS** The investigation process generally follows these crucial stages:

* **Step 1: Registration of FIR (Section 173):** The investigation officially starts with the recording of information about a cognizable offense.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** files an FIR in **Amritsar** about a stolen car.  
* **Step 2: Proceeding to the Spot (Section 176):** The Investigating Officer (IO) must go to the place where the crime occurred to inspect the scene.  
* **Step 3: Ascertainment of Facts and Circumstances:** The IO examines the surroundings and talks to people nearby to understand what happened.  
* **Step 4: Discovery and Arrest (Sections 35-48):** The IO identifies the suspect and, if necessary, arrests them.  
  * *Example:* Officer **Laukendra** in **Indore** identifies **Kanishth** as the suspect and arrests him after recording the reasons.  
* **Step 5: Collection of Evidence:**  
  * **Examination of Witnesses (Section 180):** Recording statements of persons who know about the case.  
  * **Search and Seizure (Sections 185/186):** Searching places and seizing items like weapons or stolen goods, which must be videographed under **Section 105**.  
  * *Example:* **Satyam**'s statement is recorded by the police in **Patna** as an eyewitness.  
* **Step 6: Formation of Opinion and Police Report (Section 193):** After completing the investigation, the IO forms an opinion. If there is enough evidence, a "Charge Sheet" is filed; if not, a "Closure Report" is filed.  
  * **New Timeline:** Under BNSS, the police report must be filed within **90 days** if the offense is punishable by death or 10+ years, and **60 days** for other offenses.

---

**Conclusion**

Investigation is the soul of criminal procedure. Without a proper investigation by an officer like **Saurabh** or **Raghavendra**, the court cannot reach a just conclusion. The BNSS 2023 has refined this process by providing clear definitions and mandatory timelines, ensuring that investigations are not dragged on indefinitely. By distinguishing investigation (for evidence) from inquiry (for judicial satisfaction), the law ensures that the roles of the police and the judiciary remain separate and balanced, ultimately protecting the rights of citizens in cities like **Jaipur** or **Varanasi**.

## Q9. Discuss the provisions regarding the rights of an arrested person under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 and under the Constitution of India.

**Introduction**

The protection of individual liberty is the hallmark of a democratic society. In India, this is primarily guarded by **Article 21** of the Constitution, which states that "no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." The Supreme Court, in the landmark *Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India* case, interpreted this to mean that the procedure must be "just, fair, and reasonable." The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** provides the statutory framework that translates these constitutional ideals into actionable rights for an arrested person. These rights act as a shield against potential custodial abuse and ensure that the state's power to arrest is not exercised arbitrarily.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Constitutional Rights (Articles 20 and 22\)** The Constitution of India provides fundamental safeguards that cannot be overridden by any local law:

* **Protection against Self-Incrimination \[Article 20(3)\]:** No person accused of an offense shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.  
  * *Example:* If **Satyam** is arrested in **Varanasi**, the police cannot force him to sign a confession. If they do, it is unconstitutional.  
* **Right to be Informed of Grounds \[Article 22(1)\]:** No person shall be detained without being informed of the reasons for their arrest.  
* **Right to Legal Counsel \[Article 22(1)\]:** Every arrested person has the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of their choice.  
* **Right to be Produced before a Magistrate \[Article 22(2)\]:** Every person arrested must be produced before the nearest Magistrate within **24 hours**, excluding travel time.

**2\. Rights under BNSS 2023 (Sections 35–62)** The BNSS codifies and expands these constitutional rights with specific procedural requirements:

* **Right to Know Grounds of Arrest and Bail (Sections 36 & 47):** Every police officer arresting a person without a warrant must immediately communicate the full particulars of the offense. In bailable cases, the officer must inform the person that they are entitled to be released on bail.  
  * *Example:* When **Laukendra** is arrested in **Jaipur** for a bailable offense, Officer **Raghavendra** is duty-bound to say, "You are being arrested for XYZ, and you have the right to provide a surety and go home on bail right now."  
* **Right to Inform a Nominated Person (Section 36):** A revolutionary change in BNSS is that the arrested person can name *any* person (friend, relative, or acquaintance) to be informed about their arrest and the place of detention.  
  * *Example:* **Kanishth** is arrested in **Indore**. He nominates his friend **Prateek** to be informed. The police must immediately call **Prateek** and record this in the station diary.  
* **Right to Meet an Advocate (Section 38):** An arrested person is entitled to meet an advocate of their choice during interrogation, though not throughout the entire interrogation process.  
* **The 24-Hour Rule (Section 58):** Similar to the Constitution, BNSS mandates that no person shall be detained in police custody for more than 24 hours without a special order from a Magistrate under Section 187\.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** is arrested in **Lucknow** at 10:00 AM on Monday. By 10:00 AM on Tuesday, he must be standing before a Magistrate in **Lucknow**, or he must be released.  
* **Right to Medical Examination (Sections 51 & 53):**  
  * **Section 51:** A police officer may request a medical examination of the accused if it helps the investigation (e.g., DNA profiling in rape cases).  
  * **Section 53:** Crucially, the arrested person has the right to be examined by a medical officer immediately after arrest to record any pre-existing injuries. This is a vital protection against custodial torture.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh** is arrested in **Bhopal**. He insists on a medical check-up under Section 53 to prove he has no injuries, ensuring that if he is beaten later in custody, there is a legal record of his prior state.

---

**Conclusion**

The rights of an arrested person under the BNSS 2023 and the Constitution of India form a comprehensive protective web. While the Constitution provides the "soul" of these rights (Articles 20-22), the BNSS provides the "body" through detailed sections like 36, 38, and 58\. The shift from the old CrPC to BNSS has further strengthened these rights by making the notification of a nominated person mandatory and integrating medical examinations as a standard safeguard. For citizens like **Sachkeerat** or **Satyam**, these provisions ensure that even when they are at their most vulnerable—under arrest—they remain protected by the rule of law and the dignity of human rights.

## Q10. Discuss the salient features of New Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 along with its objects and scope.

**Introduction**

The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** represents a historic transformation of India's criminal justice system. Enacted to replace the colonial-era Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, it came into effect on **July 1, 2024**. While the old Code focused heavily on "procedure" and "control," the BNSS—as its name suggests—prioritizes "Nagarik Suraksha" (Citizen Protection) and "Nyaya" (Justice). It aims to modernize the law by integrating technology, enforcing strict timelines, and making the system more victim-centric.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Objects and Scope of the Sanhita** The primary objects of the BNSS are to:

* **Decolonize the Law:** Remove the "British Raj" mindset and simplify the language and structure of criminal trials.  
* **Integrate Technology:** Formalize the use of digital evidence, e-FIRs, and virtual hearings.  
* **Expedite Justice:** Tackle the massive backlog of cases by setting mandatory deadlines for investigations, filing charge sheets, and delivering judgments.  
* **Scope:** The Sanhita extends to the **whole of India**. It governs the investigation, inquiry, and trial of all offenses under the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)** and other special laws.

**2\. Salient Features of BNSS 2023**

* **Technology-Driven Procedures (Section 173 & 530):** For the first time, "electronic communication" and "audio-video means" are legally recognized for all proceedings.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** in **Indore** can now file an **e-FIR** via a portal. If **Krishna** is a witness in **Varanasi**, he can give his statement to the court in **Lucknow** via video conferencing.  
* **Mandatory Forensics (Section 176):** The BNSS mandates that forensic experts **must** visit crime scenes for offenses punishable by **7 years or more**. They must also record the evidence collection on a mobile phone or electronic device.  
  * *Example:* In a major robbery case in **Bhopal**, Officer **Saurabh** must ensure a forensic team collects fingerprints and DNA, and the entire process is videographed to ensure no evidence is tampered with.  
* **Strict Timelines for Speedier Justice:** The Sanhita introduces "justice in a time-bound manner":  
  * **Medical Reports:** Must be sent to the Magistrate within **7 days**.  
  * **Judgment:** Must be delivered within **30 days** of completion of arguments (extendable to 45 or 60 days).  
  * **Victim Updates:** Police must inform the victim of the investigation progress within **90 days**.  
  * *Example:* **Satyam**, a victim of fraud in **Patna**, is legally entitled to get an update from the police every 90 days.  
* **Zero FIR and Preliminary Inquiry (Section 173):** The "Zero FIR" concept is now codified, allowing citizens to file an FIR at any police station regardless of jurisdiction.  
  * *Example:* If **Kanishth** is robbed while traveling in **Mumbai**, he can file an FIR in **Jaipur**. The Jaipur police will transfer it to Mumbai.  
* **Victim-Centric Reforms:** The BNSS expands the definition of a "victim" and ensures they have a voice. For example, the government cannot withdraw a case punishable by 7 years or more without giving the victim an opportunity to be heard.  
* **Community Service (Section 23):** A new form of punishment called **"Community Service"** is introduced for petty offenses, shifting the focus from punishment to rehabilitation.  
  * *Example:* **Laukendra** is caught for a minor public nuisance in **Ahmedabad**. Instead of jail, the Magistrate orders him to perform 20 hours of community service at a local government hospital.  
* **Trial in Absentia (Section 356):** If a "Proclaimed Offender" (like a terrorist or big economic offender) absconds to avoid trial, the court can now conduct the trial and deliver a judgment in their absence.

---

**Conclusion**

The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 is not merely a name change; it is a "paradigm shift." By mandating forensics, digitizing records, and enforcing strict timelines, it addresses the twin problems of delayed justice and low conviction rates. For citizens like **Raghavendra** and **Sachkeerat**, it promises a system where technology prevents corruption and where the law serves as a shield for the innocent rather than a tool for harassment. While its successful implementation depends on infrastructure and training, the Sanhita provides the blueprint for a 21st-century Indian judiciary that is fast, transparent, and fair.
