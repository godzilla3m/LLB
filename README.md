## Q1. Describe the constitution and sub-ordination of Criminal Courts. What are the provisions about it in Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023? Discuss.

**Introduction**

The administration of criminal justice in India is carried out through a well-defined hierarchy of courts. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, which replaced the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), maintains the core structure of the criminal judiciary while introducing updates to streamline functions. The "Constitution of Criminal Courts" refers to the establishment and types of courts, while "Subordination" refers to the vertical relationship of authority between these courts.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Classes of Criminal Courts (Section 6\)** Under Section 6 of the BNSS, besides the High Courts and the Supreme Court (which are governed by the Constitution), there shall be the following classes of Criminal Courts in every State:

* **Courts of Session:** The highest criminal court in a district.  
* **Judicial Magistrates of the First Class:** Handle moderately serious offenses.  
* **Judicial Magistrates of the Second Class:** Handle less serious offenses.  
* **Executive Magistrates:** Focus more on administrative and preventive measures (like maintaining public order).

**2\. Territorial Divisions and Establishment (Sections 7-10)** The State is divided into sessions divisions. Each division has a **Court of Session (Section 8\)** established by the State Government, presided over by a Judge appointed by the High Court.

* **Example:** **Prateek** lives in **Indore**, which is a sessions division. If a serious crime occurs there, the case will be heard by the Sessions Judge appointed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court.

**3\. Judicial Magistrates (Sections 11-14)** In every district, the State Government establishes Courts of Judicial Magistrates. The **Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM)** is appointed for each district to oversee the work of other Magistrates.

* **Example:** **Krishna** is a JMIC (Judicial Magistrate First Class) in **Lucknow**. He is subordinate to the CJM, **Saurabh**, who manages the distribution of cases among all Magistrates in the district.

**4\. Executive Magistrates (Section 14\)** In every district, the State Government appoints **Executive Magistrates**, one of whom is designated as the **District Magistrate (DM)**.

* **Example:** **Raghavendra** is the DM of **Varanasi**. He works alongside Sub-divisional Magistrates like **Satyam** to ensure public peace. A new provision in BNSS (Section 15\) allows the appointment of certain police officers (not below SP rank) as **Special Executive Magistrates**.

**5\. Subordination of Courts (Sections 15 & 23\)** Subordination ensures accountability and a clear path for appeals:

* All Judicial Magistrates are subordinate to the CJM.  
* The CJM and all Additional Sessions Judges are subordinate to the Sessions Judge.  
* Executive Magistrates (like **Satyam**) are subordinate to the District Magistrate (**Raghavendra**).

---

**Conclusion**

The BNSS 2023 ensures that the judicial system remains accessible and structured. By clearly defining the roles from the Sessions Judge down to the Magistrate of the Second Class, the law prevents jurisdictional chaos. The subordination of courts allows for a supervisory mechanism where higher courts can correct the legal errors of lower courts through revisions and appeals, ensuring that citizens like **Laukendra** or **Kanishth** receive a fair and standardized trial regardless of where they are in India.

---

## Q2. What is the procedure of arrest and what are the duties of the arresting officer under the Section 36 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha, 2023 ? State whether a police officer can arrest the person who complies with the terms of the notice under 35 (3) to (6).

**Introduction**

The power of arrest is one of the most significant powers granted to the police, as it directly curtails the fundamental right to personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. To prevent the misuse of this power, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** provides strict procedural safeguards. While Section 35 deals with when a police officer may arrest without a warrant, **Section 36** (formerly Section 41B of the CrPC) specifically outlines the mandatory procedure and duties of the arresting officer to ensure transparency and accountability.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Procedure and Duties under Section 36** Section 36 of the BNSS mandates that every police officer making an arrest must follow a standardized protocol:

* **Visible Identification:** The officer must bear accurate, visible, and clear identification of their name and designation to facilitate easy identification by the citizen.  
* **Preparation of Arrest Memorandum:** The officer must prepare a "Memorandum of Arrest" at the time of the arrest. This document is the primary evidence of the arrest's legality.  
* **Attestation by Witnesses:** The memorandum must be attested by at least one witness. This witness can be a member of the family of the person arrested or a "respectable member of the locality" where the arrest is made.  
  * *Example:* **Laukendra**, a police officer in **Jaipur**, arrests **Saurabh** for a theft investigation. **Laukendra** must prepare a memo and have it signed by **Saurabh**’s brother, **Satyam**, or a local shopkeeper.  
* **Countersignature:** The memorandum must be countersigned by the person arrested.  
* **Informing Rights:** If the memorandum is not attested by a family member, the officer must inform the arrested person that they have a right to have a relative or friend informed of their arrest and the place of detention.  
  * *Example:* When **Sachkeerat** is arrested in **Amritsar**, Officer **Raghavendra** must tell him, "You have the right to call your friend **Prateek** and inform him where you are being taken."

**2\. Notice of Appearance (Section 35(3) to 35(6))** The BNSS emphasizes "arrest as a last resort," especially for offenses punishable by less than seven years. Under Section 35(3), the police *shall* issue a notice of appearance rather than arresting the person immediately if an arrest is not strictly required.

* **Section 35(4):** It is the duty of the person (the noticee) to comply with the terms of the notice.  
* **Section 35(5) \- Arrest after Compliance:** The law provides a protective shield to those who cooperate. If the person complies and continues to comply with the notice, they **shall not be arrested** in respect of that offense.  
* **Exception:** A police officer **can still arrest** a complying person, but only if they record reasons in writing. The officer must be of the opinion that for proper investigation or to prevent tampering with evidence, the arrest is absolutely necessary.  
  * *Example:* **Kanishth** receives a notice to appear at a police station in **Bhopal**. He attends every day and answers questions. Officer **Krishna** cannot arrest him unless **Krishna** writes in the case diary: "I am arresting **Kanishth** because I found he is planning to flee to **Indore** to destroy the original forged documents."  
* **Section 35(6) \- Non-compliance:** If the person fails to comply or refuses to identify themselves, the police may arrest them immediately.

---

**Conclusion**

Section 36 of the BNSS acts as a vital check on police "high-handedness" by mandating documentation and witness involvement. Regarding the notice under Section 35, the legislative intent is clear: cooperation should be rewarded with freedom. A person who complies with the notice generally cannot be arrested. However, the law provides a narrow window for arrest in exceptional circumstances, provided the officer records the specific necessity in writing. This ensures that the arrest is an "individualized" act of justice rather than a mechanical routine, as recently upheld by various High Courts in 2025\.

## Q3. Who can claim maintenance under Section 144 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 ? No wife shall be entitled to receive maintenance from her husband without any sufficient reason if she refuses to live with her husband or they are living separately by mutual consent. Discuss.

**Introduction**

Section 144 of the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, which corresponds to the erstwhile Section 125 of the CrPC, is a secular and social-welfare provision. Its primary objective is to prevent "vagrancy and destitution" by providing a summary legal remedy for financial support. It enforces the moral and legal obligation of a person with sufficient means to support their dependent family members who are unable to maintain themselves.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Who can claim maintenance? (Section 144(1))** Under Section 144(1), if a person has sufficient means but neglects or refuses to maintain the following dependents, a Magistrate of the First Class can order monthly maintenance:

* **The Wife:** A wife who is unable to maintain herself. The term "wife" includes a woman who has been divorced and has not remarried.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** and his wife **Anjali** are separated in **Indore**. If **Anjali** is unable to support herself, she can claim maintenance from **Prateek**.  
* **Legitimate or Illegitimate Children:**  
  * **Minor Children:** Whether married or not, who cannot maintain themselves.  
  * **Major Children:** If they have reached majority but are unable to maintain themselves due to physical or mental abnormality or injury (excluding married daughters).  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh** in **Bhopal** must maintain his 10-year-old son **Kanishth**, even if **Kanishth** was born out of wedlock.  
* **Father or Mother:** Parents who are unable to maintain themselves. This duty extends to both sons and daughters.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna**, working in **Bangalore**, is legally bound to provide for his aged father **Raghavendra** who lives in **Varanasi** and has no source of income.

**2\. Grounds for Denial of Maintenance (Section 144(4))** The law provides specific circumstances under which a wife is **not** entitled to maintenance:

* **Adultery:** If she is living in adultery.  
* **Refusal to live together without sufficient reason:** If she refuses to live with her husband without a valid legal or personal justification.  
* **Mutual Consent:** If the couple is living separately by mutual agreement.  
  * *Example:* **Laukendra** and his wife decide to live separately in **Jaipur** to pursue independent careers and sign an agreement stating neither will claim support. In this case, the wife cannot later claim maintenance under Section 144\.

**3\. "Sufficient Reason" for Living Separately** The court does not blindly apply the rule of refusal. If a wife has a "just ground," she can live separately and still claim maintenance.

* **Husband's Misconduct:** Cruelty, desertion, or the husband contracting a second marriage/keeping a mistress are considered sufficient reasons.  
  * *Example:* **Satyam** marries another woman while still being married to **Priya** in **Patna**. If **Priya** refuses to live with **Satyam** because of this, the court will rule her refusal is "justified," and **Satyam** must still pay her maintenance.  
* **Standard of Living:** As established in recent 2025 rulings, "unable to maintain herself" does not mean the wife must be in absolute poverty; she is entitled to a standard of living similar to what she enjoyed at her husband's house.

---

**Conclusion**

Section 144 of the BNSS is a pillar of social justice that ensures vulnerable individuals—wives, children, and the elderly—are not left to starve. While it protects the right to maintenance, it also balances this with Section 144(4) to ensure the law is not misused. By requiring "sufficient reason" for living separately, the Sanhita encourages the preservation of the marital home while simultaneously protecting the dignity of a woman like **Priya** or **Anjali** who may be forced to live apart due to the husband's misconduct.

## Q4. Discuss the conditional order for removal of nuisance under Section 152 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 and the procedure adopted where disputes concerning land and water are likely to cause breach of peace.

**Introduction**

Maintaining public order and tranquility is a primary function of the Executive. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** empowers Executive Magistrates to take swift action against public nuisances and property disputes that could lead to violence. **Section 152** of the BNSS (corresponding to Section 133 of the old CrPC) provides a mechanism for the "conditional removal" of public nuisances, while **Section 164** (old Section 145\) outlines the procedure for resolving land and water disputes to prevent a breach of peace. These provisions are preventive and remedial, rather than punitive.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Conditional Order for Removal of Nuisance (Section 152\)** Section 152 allows a District Magistrate (DM), Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM), or specially empowered Executive Magistrate to intervene when a public nuisance is reported.

* **Grounds for Action:** The Magistrate may act if there is:  
  * An unlawful obstruction or nuisance in a public place, way, or river.  
  * A trade or occupation injurious to health or comfort.  
  * A dangerous building, tree, or structure likely to fall and cause injury.  
  * An unfenced tank, well, or excavation near a public way.  
* **The Conditional Nature:** The Magistrate does not pass a final order immediately. Instead, they issue a "conditional order" requiring the person to either remove the nuisance within a fixed time or appear in court to "show cause" why the order should not be made absolute.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh** runs a chemical unit in **Bhopal** that releases toxic fumes into a residential colony. **Prateek**, an SDM, issues a conditional order under Section 152 directing **Saurabh** to either install filters within 15 days or show cause why the unit should not be shut down.

**2\. Disputes Concerning Land or Water (Section 164\)** When a dispute over land or water is likely to cause a "breach of peace," the Executive Magistrate intervenes under Section 164\.

* **Initiation:** The Magistrate must be "satisfied" from a police report or other information that a dispute exists.  
* **The Preliminary Order:** The Magistrate makes a written order requiring the parties to attend court and put in written statements of their claims regarding "actual possession" of the property.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** and **Kanishth** are fighting over the boundaries of a farm in **Indore**. The local police report that both have gathered armed supporters. **Raghavendra**, the DM, issues an order under Section 164 for both to appear and prove who was in possession of the land.  
* **Inquiry into Possession:** The Magistrate’s role is **not** to decide who "owns" the land (title), but who was in "actual possession" at the time of the preliminary order. If a party was forcibly and wrongfully dispossessed within two months before the report, the Magistrate may treat them as if they were in possession.  
* **Final Order:** The Magistrate then declares the possessing party entitled to remain there until "evicted in due course of law" by a civil court.

**3\. Specific Categories (Section 164(2))** "Land or water" is defined broadly to include buildings, markets, fisheries, crops, and even the rents or profits derived from such property. \* *Example:* **Laukendra** and **Satyam** have a dispute over the fishing rights in a pond in **Varanasi**. Because this threatens local peace, the Magistrate applies the Section 164 procedure to decide who currently manages the pond.

---

**Conclusion**

Sections 152 and 164 of the BNSS serve as essential tools for the "preventive" administration of justice. Section 152 balances public health and safety with the right to be heard through its "conditional" approach. Meanwhile, Section 164 acts as a temporary "stop-gap" to prevent blood-shed over property, leaving the final determination of ownership to the Civil Courts. By focusing on "possession" rather than "title," the law ensures that citizens like **Sachkeerat** or **Kanishth** do not take the law into their own hands while waiting for a long civil trial, thereby preserving the public tranquility of cities like **Prayagraj** or **Jaipur**.

## Q5. What do you understand by the cognizance of an offence by a Magistrate? Discuss the procedure in detail.

**Introduction**

The term **"Cognizance"** is not explicitly defined in the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** or its predecessor, the CrPC. However, judicially, it means "taking judicial notice" of an offense. It is the crucial stage where the investigative process ends and the judicial process begins. It is the point at which a Magistrate decides that there is sufficient material on record to initiate proceedings against an accused person. **Section 210** of the BNSS (formerly Section 190 of the CrPC) outlines the powers of a Magistrate to take cognizance.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Meaning of Cognizance** Taking cognizance does not mean the start of a trial; it merely means the Magistrate has applied their "judicial mind" to the facts of the case to see if an offense has been committed. It is a condition precedent to the initiation of proceedings.

* **Example:** If **Satyam** files a report about a theft in **Varanasi**, the Magistrate **Prateek** "takes cognizance" the moment he reads the file and decides to call for witnesses or issue a summons.

**2\. Who can take Cognizance? (Section 210\)**

* Any **Magistrate of the First Class** can take cognizance of any offense.  
* A **Magistrate of the Second Class** can also do so if specially empowered by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM).  
* **Example:** **Saurabh**, a JMIC in **Bhopal**, is competent to take cognizance of a fraud case involving **Kanishth**.

**3\. Three Modes of Taking Cognizance (Section 210(1))** A Magistrate can take cognizance in three distinct ways:

* **(a) Upon a Complaint:** Receiving a written or oral allegation of facts that constitute an offense.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** goes directly to court in **Jaipur** and files a private complaint against **Raghavendra** for defamation.  
* **(b) Upon a Police Report:** After the police complete an investigation and file a "Charge Sheet" or "Final Report" under Section 193 (old Sec 173).  
  * *Example:* The **Lucknow** police submit a report stating that **Laukendra** was involved in a brawl. Magistrate **Sachkeerat** takes cognizance based on this report.  
* **(c) Upon Information/Sua Sponte:** Upon information from any person other than a police officer or the Magistrate’s own knowledge.

**4\. The Procedure: Post-Cognizance Steps** Once a Magistrate decides to take cognizance, the procedure depends on how the case reached them:

* **In Complaint Cases (Sections 223–226):**  
  * The Magistrate must examine the complainant (e.g., **Krishna**) and any witnesses on oath.  
  * **New Provision in BNSS:** A significant change in the BNSS (Proviso to Section 223\) is that the Magistrate **must** give the accused an opportunity of being heard before taking cognizance in certain cases, especially to prevent frivolous litigation.  
* **In Police Report Cases:**  
  * The Magistrate examines the "Case Diary" and the "Charge Sheet." If they find a *prima facie* case, they issue a "Process" (Summons or Warrant) to the accused under Section 227 to begin the trial.  
  * **Timeline:** Under the BNSS, the Magistrate must decide whether to take cognizance within **14 days** of receiving the charge sheet to ensure a speedy trial.

---

**Conclusion**

Cognizance is the "bridge" between investigation and trial. It acts as a safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by ensuring that no person is forced to stand trial unless a judicial officer like **Prateek** or **Saurabh** is satisfied that a crime has indeed occurred. The BNSS 2023 has modernized this stage by introducing strict timelines (14 days) and mandatory hearings for the accused in complaint cases, thereby balancing the rights of the victim with the protection of the innocent from malicious prosecution in cities like **Indore** or **Patna**.

## Q6. Discuss the laws relating to information in cognizable cases under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\. What new provisions have been inserted in this Sanhita and what is its evidentiary value ? Discuss.

**Introduction**

In the Indian criminal justice system, the First Information Report (FIR) is the document that sets the machinery of law into motion. While the term "FIR" is not explicitly defined in the law, it is embodied in the provisions relating to "Information in Cognizable Cases." Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, these provisions are contained in **Section 173**, which replaces the erstwhile Section 154 of the CrPC. A cognizable case is one where a police officer may arrest without a warrant. The BNSS has modernized this process by integrating technology and introducing mandatory timelines to ensure transparency and efficiency.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Laws Relating to Information (Section 173\)** Section 173 mandates that every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offense, if given to an officer in charge of a police station, must be recorded.

* **Oral Information:** If given orally, it must be reduced to writing, read over to the informant, and signed by them.  
* **Electronic Information (e-FIR):** Information can now be given by "electronic communication." However, to be officially recorded as an FIR, the informant must sign it within **three days**.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** witnesses a robbery in **Lucknow**. He sends an email to the local police station. For this to become a formal FIR, **Prateek** must visit the station or provide a digital signature within 72 hours.

**2\. New Provisions in BNSS** The BNSS has introduced several groundbreaking updates to the FIR process:

* **Zero FIR:** Section 173(1) now explicitly states that information can be given "irrespective of the area where the offense is committed." This codifies the "Zero FIR" concept, meaning a police station cannot refuse a complaint just because the crime happened elsewhere.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** is mugged in **Mumbai** but travels back to his home in **Nagpur**. He can file a Zero FIR in **Nagpur**, which will then be transferred to the relevant station in **Mumbai**.  
* **Preliminary Inquiry (Section 173(3)):** For offenses punishable by **3 to 7 years**, the police now have the discretion to conduct a preliminary inquiry to see if a *prima facie* case exists before registering an FIR. This must be done with the prior permission of an officer (not below DSP rank) and completed within **14 days**.  
  * *Example:* **Raghavendra** is accused of a complex financial fraud in **Indore**. Officer **Saurabh** (DSP) authorizes a 14-day inquiry to check the bank records before officially naming **Raghavendra** in an FIR.  
* **Videography:** For sexual offenses, the recording of the victim's information must be videographed to preserve the integrity of the statement.  
* **Progress Reports:** The police are now legally bound to inform the victim/informant of the progress of the investigation within **90 days**.

**3\. Evidentiary Value of Information** It is a settled principle that an FIR is **not substantive evidence**. This means a court cannot convict someone based *only* on what is written in the FIR because it is not made under oath and is not subject to cross-examination.

* **Corroboration:** It can be used under the **Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA)** to corroborate the testimony of the person who gave the information.  
* **Contradiction:** It can be used by the defense to contradict the informant if they change their story during the trial.  
  * *Example:* If **Kanishth** tells the police in **Bhopal** that he saw **Laukendra** with a knife, but in court says it was a gun, the defense will use the FIR to "contradict" his credibility.  
* **Exception (Dying Declaration):** If the informant dies after filing the FIR, the report can become substantive evidence as a "Dying Declaration."

---

**Conclusion**

The transition from Section 154 CrPC to Section 173 BNSS reflects a shift from "colonial control" to "citizen-centric justice." By codifying Zero FIR and e-FIR, the law ensures that geographical and technological barriers do not prevent a victim like **Satyam** or **Sachkeerat** from seeking justice. While the evidentiary value remains limited to corroboration and contradiction to prevent false implications, the new safeguards like mandatory videography and fixed timelines for preliminary inquiries bring a much-needed balance between the power of the police and the rights of the accused in modern India.

## Q7. Describe the procedure for search and seizure under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\.

**Introduction**

Search and seizure are essential investigative tools used by law enforcement to collect evidence, recover stolen property, or find persons wrongfully confined. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, these powers are balanced with procedural safeguards to protect the privacy and dignity of citizens. While the basic framework remains similar to the old CrPC (Sections 94–124 and 185), the BNSS introduces a revolutionary change: the **mandatory videography** of the entire process to ensure transparency and prevent the planting of evidence.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. General Principles of Search (Section 103\)** Section 103 (formerly Section 100 of CrPC) provides the "Gold Standard" for conducting a search. Whether it is a house, shop, or vehicle, the following rules apply:

* **Independence of Witnesses:** Before starting a search, the officer must call upon two or more independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality to attend and witness the search.  
* **Presence of the Occupant:** The occupant of the place or their representative must be allowed to attend the search.  
* **The Search List:** A list of all things seized (Seizure Memo) must be prepared and signed by the witnesses. A copy of this list must be delivered to the occupant.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh**, a police officer in **Bhopal**, conducts a search of **Kanishth**’s godown. He calls **Prateek** and **Krishna**, two local shopkeepers, to witness the process. Every item found is noted down, and **Kanishth** receives a signed copy of the list.

**2\. Mandatory Audio-Video Recording (Section 105\)** This is the most significant update in the BNSS. Section 105 mandates that the process of search and seizure, including the preparation of the seizure list and the signing by witnesses, **shall be recorded** through audio-video electronic means (preferably a mobile phone).

* **Forwarding to Magistrate:** The recording must be forwarded without delay to the District Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate, or Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.  
  * *Example:* While searching a suspect's house in **Indore**, Officer **Laukendra** uses his smartphone to record the discovery of a hidden locker. This video proves that the evidence was not planted and was found in the presence of witnesses **Satyam** and **Raghavendra**.

**3\. Search Without Warrant (Section 185\)** An Investigating Officer (IO) can search a place without a warrant if they have "reasonable grounds" to believe that a warrant cannot be obtained without the risk of the evidence being destroyed or concealed.

* **Recording Reasons:** The officer must record the grounds of their belief in the case diary before proceeding.  
* **48-Hour Rule:** Under Section 185(5), the IO must send copies of the record (reasons and search results) to the nearest Magistrate within **48 hours**.  
  * *Example:* **Sachkeerat**, a police officer in **Amritsar**, receives a tip that a suspect is about to burn forged documents. He cannot wait for a court warrant, so he records his reasons and searches the house immediately, ensuring the process is videographed.

**4\. Seizure of Property (Section 107\)** The BNSS expands the power to seize property. While the old law focused on movable property, **Section 107** now specifically includes **immovable property** that is suspected to be "proceeds of crime."

* **Example:** If the police find that a bungalow in **Lucknow** was bought using money from a large-scale scam, they can now move to attach/seize that immovable property during the investigation.

---

**Conclusion**

The procedure for search and seizure under the BNSS 2023 is designed to move away from the "police-heavy" approach of the past toward a "technology-driven" transparent system. By making videography mandatory under Section 105, the law protects officers from false allegations of corruption and protects citizens like **Kanishth** or **Satyam** from the "planting" of evidence. This digital trail ensures that the evidence presented in courts in **Jaipur** or **Varanasi** is credible, thereby strengthening the foundation of a fair trial.

## Q8. What is Investigation of Crime? How does it differ from inquiry? Discuss the main stages of the investigation as contained in the provisions of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\.

**Introduction**

The process of criminal justice begins the moment a crime is reported. The initial phase, where the police work to uncover the truth and collect evidence, is known as "Investigation." Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)**, investigation is the bedrock upon which a trial is built. It is an administrative process conducted primarily by the police to identify the offender and gather material to prove the case in court. While "Investigation" and "Inquiry" are often used interchangeably in common parlance, they are distinct legal terms under the BNSS with different objectives and authorities.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Meaning of Investigation and Inquiry**

* **Investigation \[Section 2(1)(l)\]:** It includes all proceedings for the **collection of evidence** conducted by a police officer or any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorized by a Magistrate in this behalf.  
* **Inquiry \[Section 2(1)(k)\]:** It means every inquiry, **other than a trial**, conducted under this Sanhita by a Magistrate or Court. Its purpose is to determine the truth or falsity of certain facts to decide if a trial should begin.

**2\. Key Differences** | Feature | Investigation | Inquiry | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | **Authority** | Conducted by Police or authorized person. | Conducted by a Magistrate or Court. | | **Objective** | To collect evidence. | To determine the truth/falsity of facts. | | **Nature** | Administrative/Non-judicial. | Judicial or Quasi-judicial. | | **Stage** | First stage (precedes inquiry). | Second stage (follows investigation). |

* *Example:* **Saurabh**, a police officer in **Bhopal**, collects blood samples from a crime scene. This is **Investigation**. When these facts are presented to Magistrate **Prateek**, he examines the witnesses to decide if there is a case. This is **Inquiry**.

**3\. Main Stages of Investigation under BNSS** The investigation process generally follows these crucial stages:

* **Step 1: Registration of FIR (Section 173):** The investigation officially starts with the recording of information about a cognizable offense.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** files an FIR in **Amritsar** about a stolen car.  
* **Step 2: Proceeding to the Spot (Section 176):** The Investigating Officer (IO) must go to the place where the crime occurred to inspect the scene.  
* **Step 3: Ascertainment of Facts and Circumstances:** The IO examines the surroundings and talks to people nearby to understand what happened.  
* **Step 4: Discovery and Arrest (Sections 35-48):** The IO identifies the suspect and, if necessary, arrests them.  
  * *Example:* Officer **Laukendra** in **Indore** identifies **Kanishth** as the suspect and arrests him after recording the reasons.  
* **Step 5: Collection of Evidence:**  
  * **Examination of Witnesses (Section 180):** Recording statements of persons who know about the case.  
  * **Search and Seizure (Sections 185/186):** Searching places and seizing items like weapons or stolen goods, which must be videographed under **Section 105**.  
  * *Example:* **Satyam**'s statement is recorded by the police in **Patna** as an eyewitness.  
* **Step 6: Formation of Opinion and Police Report (Section 193):** After completing the investigation, the IO forms an opinion. If there is enough evidence, a "Charge Sheet" is filed; if not, a "Closure Report" is filed.  
  * **New Timeline:** Under BNSS, the police report must be filed within **90 days** if the offense is punishable by death or 10+ years, and **60 days** for other offenses.

---

**Conclusion**

Investigation is the soul of criminal procedure. Without a proper investigation by an officer like **Saurabh** or **Raghavendra**, the court cannot reach a just conclusion. The BNSS 2023 has refined this process by providing clear definitions and mandatory timelines, ensuring that investigations are not dragged on indefinitely. By distinguishing investigation (for evidence) from inquiry (for judicial satisfaction), the law ensures that the roles of the police and the judiciary remain separate and balanced, ultimately protecting the rights of citizens in cities like **Jaipur** or **Varanasi**.

## Q9. Discuss the provisions regarding the rights of an arrested person under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 and under the Constitution of India.

**Introduction**

The protection of individual liberty is the hallmark of a democratic society. In India, this is primarily guarded by **Article 21** of the Constitution, which states that "no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." The Supreme Court, in the landmark *Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India* case, interpreted this to mean that the procedure must be "just, fair, and reasonable." The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** provides the statutory framework that translates these constitutional ideals into actionable rights for an arrested person. These rights act as a shield against potential custodial abuse and ensure that the state's power to arrest is not exercised arbitrarily.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Constitutional Rights (Articles 20 and 22\)** The Constitution of India provides fundamental safeguards that cannot be overridden by any local law:

* **Protection against Self-Incrimination \[Article 20(3)\]:** No person accused of an offense shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.  
  * *Example:* If **Satyam** is arrested in **Varanasi**, the police cannot force him to sign a confession. If they do, it is unconstitutional.  
* **Right to be Informed of Grounds \[Article 22(1)\]:** No person shall be detained without being informed of the reasons for their arrest.  
* **Right to Legal Counsel \[Article 22(1)\]:** Every arrested person has the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of their choice.  
* **Right to be Produced before a Magistrate \[Article 22(2)\]:** Every person arrested must be produced before the nearest Magistrate within **24 hours**, excluding travel time.

**2\. Rights under BNSS 2023 (Sections 35–62)** The BNSS codifies and expands these constitutional rights with specific procedural requirements:

* **Right to Know Grounds of Arrest and Bail (Sections 36 & 47):** Every police officer arresting a person without a warrant must immediately communicate the full particulars of the offense. In bailable cases, the officer must inform the person that they are entitled to be released on bail.  
  * *Example:* When **Laukendra** is arrested in **Jaipur** for a bailable offense, Officer **Raghavendra** is duty-bound to say, "You are being arrested for XYZ, and you have the right to provide a surety and go home on bail right now."  
* **Right to Inform a Nominated Person (Section 36):** A revolutionary change in BNSS is that the arrested person can name *any* person (friend, relative, or acquaintance) to be informed about their arrest and the place of detention.  
  * *Example:* **Kanishth** is arrested in **Indore**. He nominates his friend **Prateek** to be informed. The police must immediately call **Prateek** and record this in the station diary.  
* **Right to Meet an Advocate (Section 38):** An arrested person is entitled to meet an advocate of their choice during interrogation, though not throughout the entire interrogation process.  
* **The 24-Hour Rule (Section 58):** Similar to the Constitution, BNSS mandates that no person shall be detained in police custody for more than 24 hours without a special order from a Magistrate under Section 187\.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** is arrested in **Lucknow** at 10:00 AM on Monday. By 10:00 AM on Tuesday, he must be standing before a Magistrate in **Lucknow**, or he must be released.  
* **Right to Medical Examination (Sections 51 & 53):**  
  * **Section 51:** A police officer may request a medical examination of the accused if it helps the investigation (e.g., DNA profiling in rape cases).  
  * **Section 53:** Crucially, the arrested person has the right to be examined by a medical officer immediately after arrest to record any pre-existing injuries. This is a vital protection against custodial torture.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh** is arrested in **Bhopal**. He insists on a medical check-up under Section 53 to prove he has no injuries, ensuring that if he is beaten later in custody, there is a legal record of his prior state.

---

**Conclusion**

The rights of an arrested person under the BNSS 2023 and the Constitution of India form a comprehensive protective web. While the Constitution provides the "soul" of these rights (Articles 20-22), the BNSS provides the "body" through detailed sections like 36, 38, and 58\. The shift from the old CrPC to BNSS has further strengthened these rights by making the notification of a nominated person mandatory and integrating medical examinations as a standard safeguard. For citizens like **Sachkeerat** or **Satyam**, these provisions ensure that even when they are at their most vulnerable—under arrest—they remain protected by the rule of law and the dignity of human rights.

## Q10. Discuss the salient features of New Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 along with its objects and scope.

**Introduction**

The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)** represents a historic transformation of India's criminal justice system. Enacted to replace the colonial-era Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, it came into effect on **July 1, 2024**. While the old Code focused heavily on "procedure" and "control," the BNSS—as its name suggests—prioritizes "Nagarik Suraksha" (Citizen Protection) and "Nyaya" (Justice). It aims to modernize the law by integrating technology, enforcing strict timelines, and making the system more victim-centric.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Objects and Scope of the Sanhita** The primary objects of the BNSS are to:

* **Decolonize the Law:** Remove the "British Raj" mindset and simplify the language and structure of criminal trials.  
* **Integrate Technology:** Formalize the use of digital evidence, e-FIRs, and virtual hearings.  
* **Expedite Justice:** Tackle the massive backlog of cases by setting mandatory deadlines for investigations, filing charge sheets, and delivering judgments.  
* **Scope:** The Sanhita extends to the **whole of India**. It governs the investigation, inquiry, and trial of all offenses under the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)** and other special laws.

**2\. Salient Features of BNSS 2023**

* **Technology-Driven Procedures (Section 173 & 530):** For the first time, "electronic communication" and "audio-video means" are legally recognized for all proceedings.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** in **Indore** can now file an **e-FIR** via a portal. If **Krishna** is a witness in **Varanasi**, he can give his statement to the court in **Lucknow** via video conferencing.  
* **Mandatory Forensics (Section 176):** The BNSS mandates that forensic experts **must** visit crime scenes for offenses punishable by **7 years or more**. They must also record the evidence collection on a mobile phone or electronic device.  
  * *Example:* In a major robbery case in **Bhopal**, Officer **Saurabh** must ensure a forensic team collects fingerprints and DNA, and the entire process is videographed to ensure no evidence is tampered with.  
* **Strict Timelines for Speedier Justice:** The Sanhita introduces "justice in a time-bound manner":  
  * **Medical Reports:** Must be sent to the Magistrate within **7 days**.  
  * **Judgment:** Must be delivered within **30 days** of completion of arguments (extendable to 45 or 60 days).  
  * **Victim Updates:** Police must inform the victim of the investigation progress within **90 days**.  
  * *Example:* **Satyam**, a victim of fraud in **Patna**, is legally entitled to get an update from the police every 90 days.  
* **Zero FIR and Preliminary Inquiry (Section 173):** The "Zero FIR" concept is now codified, allowing citizens to file an FIR at any police station regardless of jurisdiction.  
  * *Example:* If **Kanishth** is robbed while traveling in **Mumbai**, he can file an FIR in **Jaipur**. The Jaipur police will transfer it to Mumbai.  
* **Victim-Centric Reforms:** The BNSS expands the definition of a "victim" and ensures they have a voice. For example, the government cannot withdraw a case punishable by 7 years or more without giving the victim an opportunity to be heard.  
* **Community Service (Section 23):** A new form of punishment called **"Community Service"** is introduced for petty offenses, shifting the focus from punishment to rehabilitation.  
  * *Example:* **Laukendra** is caught for a minor public nuisance in **Ahmedabad**. Instead of jail, the Magistrate orders him to perform 20 hours of community service at a local government hospital.  
* **Trial in Absentia (Section 356):** If a "Proclaimed Offender" (like a terrorist or big economic offender) absconds to avoid trial, the court can now conduct the trial and deliver a judgment in their absence.

---

**Conclusion**

The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 is not merely a name change; it is a "paradigm shift." By mandating forensics, digitizing records, and enforcing strict timelines, it addresses the twin problems of delayed justice and low conviction rates. For citizens like **Raghavendra** and **Sachkeerat**, it promises a system where technology prevents corruption and where the law serves as a shield for the innocent rather than a tool for harassment. While its successful implementation depends on infrastructure and training, the Sanhita provides the blueprint for a 21st-century Indian judiciary that is fast, transparent, and fair.

Long Answer Type Question

## Q1. Whether the nature of offences or offenders can be the basis of reasonable classification under Art. 14 of the Constitution of India?

**Introduction**

Article 14 of the Constitution of India is the cornerstone of the right to equality. It mandates that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. While this sounds like a mandate for absolute mathematical equality, the Supreme Court has long recognized that "equals must be treated equally," and that the diverse needs of a complex society require different laws for different classes of persons. This realization led to the evolution of the "Doctrine of Reasonable Classification." This doctrine posits that Article 14 does not forbid classification; it only forbids "class legislation"—which is a discriminatory or arbitrary selection of a group. To be constitutional, a classification must satisfy two essential conditions: it must be founded on an "intelligible differentia" which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out, and that differentia must have a "rational nexus" with the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question. In the realm of criminal law, the nature of the offenses and the characteristics of the offenders are frequently used as a basis for such classification to ensure that the punishment fits both the crime and the criminal.

**Main Body**

The nature of offenses often necessitates a different procedural or substantive approach. For instance, the State may decide that certain heinous offenses, such as terrorism or organized crime, require a speedier trial or a more stringent bail process than ordinary offenses like simple theft. In a landmark case, **State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar**, the Supreme Court analyzed whether the State could refer "any cases" to special courts for "speedier trial." While the Court initially struck down the vague power in that specific case, it established that if a statute provides clear guidelines on what "classes of offenses" (such as those involving public safety or state security) qualify, the classification is valid.

Consider an example: **Prateek** and **Krishna** are both residents of **Lucknow**. **Prateek** is accused of a petty pickpocketing incident, while **Krishna** is accused of being part of a large-scale cyber-terrorist sleeper cell. The law may mandate that **Krishna** be tried in a Special Court under a specific Sanhita provision with stricter evidence rules, while **Prateek** is tried in a regular Magistrate Court. This classification is reasonable because the "nature of the offense" committed by **Krishna** poses a direct threat to national security, justifying a different procedural path compared to **Prateek's** minor crime.

Similarly, the nature of the offender can be a valid ground for classification. The law does not treat a child, a first-time offender, or a woman the same way it treats a hardened, habitual criminal. This is seen in laws like the Juvenile Justice Act or provisions for probation. For instance, if **Kanishth**, a 15-year-old boy in **Bhopal**, commits a theft, he is sent to a Reformatory Home and his trial is private. However, if **Raghavendra**, a 40-year-old repeat offender in the same city, commits the same theft, he is sent to a central jail. This classification based on "age" and "criminal history" is reasonable because the object is the reformation of the child, which differs from the deterrent objective for **Raghavendra**.

Furthermore, special protections are often accorded to women offenders. If **Laukendra**, a police officer in **Indore**, needs to arrest **Saurabh**, a male suspect, he can do so at any time. However, if he needs to arrest a female suspect like **Satyam’s** sister after sunset, the law (Section 43 of BNSS) requires the presence of a woman police officer and a Magistrate’s order. This classification between "male" and "female" offenders is protected by Article 15(3) and is considered a reasonable classification under Article 14 because it addresses the specific vulnerability of women in custodial settings. In **Varanasi**, if **Sachkeerat** is a first-time offender who committed a crime out of desperation, the court might grant him probation under Section 360 of CrPC (or relevant BNSS provisions), whereas a habitual offender would not receive such leniency. This distinguishes offenders based on their "potential for reform," which has a rational nexus with the goal of social rehabilitation.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the nature of offenses and the attributes of offenders are not only valid but often necessary bases for classification under Article 14\. The law cannot be a one-size-fits-all mechanism. By distinguishing between the gravity of a crime—such as the difference between **Krishna’s** cyber-terrorism and **Prateek’s** petty theft—the legal system ensures that judicial resources are concentrated where they are most needed. By distinguishing between offenders—such as the difference between the minor **Kanishth** and the habitual **Raghavendra**—the system balances the need for punishment with the hope for rehabilitation. As long as these classifications are not arbitrary, capricious, or based on irrelevant criteria, and as long as they serve a legitimate legislative goal like public safety or juvenile welfare, they remain perfectly constitutional. The Indian judiciary continues to use the "intelligible differentia" and "rational nexus" tests to ensure that while the law may differentiate, it never discriminates.

## Q3. Discuss the protection in respect of Conviction for offences under Art. 20 of the Constitution of India.

**Introduction**

Article 20 of the Constitution of India is one of the most vital fundamental rights, providing essential safeguards to individuals against arbitrary and excessive punishment by the State. It is so fundamental that even during a National Emergency, this right cannot be suspended (as per the 44th Amendment). The primary objective of Article 20 is to protect the liberty of individuals, whether they are citizens, foreigners, or even legal entities like corporations, by ensuring that the criminal justice system operates on principles of fairness and the rule of law. It acts as a check on the powers of the legislature and the executive, preventing them from creating or applying laws that are oppressive or retrospective in nature. Article 20 consists of three distinct clauses: protection against ex post facto laws, protection against double jeopardy, and the prohibition of self-incrimination.

**Main Body**

**1\. Protection against Ex Post Facto Laws (Article 20(1))**

The first clause of Article 20 prohibits "ex post facto" laws, which are laws that impose penalties retroactively. It has two components: First, a person can only be convicted for an act that was a "violation of a law in force" at the time the act was committed. If an act was legal when done, it cannot be made a crime later with retrospective effect. Second, a person cannot be subjected to a penalty greater than what was prescribed by the law at the time of the commission of the offense.

For example, imagine **Prateek** performs an action in **Indore** on December 1st. On December 10th, the government passes a law making that action a crime. Under Article 20(1), **Prateek** cannot be punished because the law was not "in force" on December 1st. Similarly, if **Krishna** commits a crime in **Lucknow** for which the punishment is two years, and the law is changed to five years while his trial is pending, **Krishna** can only be sentenced to a maximum of two years.

**2\. Protection against Double Jeopardy (Article 20(2))**

The second clause embodies the principle of "nemo debet bis vexari," which means no one should be put in peril twice for the same offense. It states that "no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once." It is important to note that for this protection to apply, the person must have been both "prosecuted" and "punished" in the first instance by a court or judicial tribunal. Departmental inquiries or administrative actions do not count as "prosecution" for this purpose.

Consider **Kanishth** in **Bhopal**. If **Kanishth** is tried for theft, convicted, and serves his sentence, he cannot be put on trial again for that same specific theft incident. However, if **Raghavendra**, a government employee in **Patna**, is dismissed from service after a departmental inquiry for corruption and is later prosecuted in a criminal court for the same act, it is not double jeopardy because the departmental action was not a "judicial punishment."

**3\. Prohibition against Self-Incrimination (Article 20(3))**

The third clause provides that "no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself." This protects an accused person from being forced to give testimony that could lead to their own conviction. This right covers both oral and documentary evidence. However, the Supreme Court has clarified that this does not prevent the police from taking thumb impressions, blood samples, or specimen signatures, as these are "physical" rather than "testimonial" evidence.

For instance, if **Laukendra** is an accused in **Jaipur**, the police cannot beat or threaten him to force him to confess. If **Saurabh**, the investigating officer, compels **Laukendra** to sign a self-incriminating statement, that statement will be inadmissible in court. On the other hand, if **Satyam** is asked to provide a DNA sample in **Varanasi** to match evidence at a crime scene, he cannot refuse it under Article 20(3) because it is not "testifying" against himself.

**Conclusion**

Article 20 serves as a robust shield for the individual against the might of the State. By prohibiting retrospective criminal laws, the Constitution ensures that people like **Sachkeerat** can know the consequences of their actions beforehand. By preventing double jeopardy, it protects citizens from perpetual harassment by the legal system. Finally, by barring self-incrimination, it upholds the dignity of the individual and ensures that the burden of proving a case lies squarely on the prosecution rather than through coerced confessions. These three protections together ensure that "conviction for offenses" is based on established, fair, and transparent judicial processes, which is the hallmark of Indian democracy and the rule of law.

## Q4. Explain the rationale of Criminal Procedure with reference to Art. 21 of the Constitution of India.

**Introduction**

Article 21 of the Constitution of India is the heart of fundamental rights, declaring that "no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." While this article is concisely worded, its impact on the criminal justice system is monumental. The "rationale" of criminal procedure—whether under the old CrPC or the new **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**—is to provide the very "procedure" mentioned in Article 21\. Initially, in the **A.K. Gopalan case**, the Supreme Court took a narrow view, suggesting any state-enacted procedure was sufficient. However, the landmark **Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)** ruling revolutionized this, establishing that the procedure must not just exist but must be "right, just, and fair," and not arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive. Thus, Article 21 acts as a constitutional filter through which every provision of the BNSS must pass.

**Main Body**

The rationale of criminal procedure is to balance two competing interests: the power of the State to maintain order by punishing criminals, and the right of the individual to be protected from state tyranny. Article 21 ensures that this balance is maintained through several key procedural pillars.

The first pillar is the **Right to a Fair Trial**. A procedure cannot be "fair" if the accused is not given a proper opportunity to defend themselves. This includes the right to an open trial, an impartial judge, and the right to cross-examine witnesses. For instance, imagine **Prateek** is accused of a crime in **Indore**. If the court holds a secret trial without allowing **Prateek** to see the evidence against him, the procedure violates Article 21\. The BNSS ensures fairness by mandating that trials, as far as practicable, be conducted in open court and that the accused be provided with copies of the police report and other documents (Section 230).

The second pillar is the **Right to a Speedy Trial**. As the saying goes, "justice delayed is justice denied." The Supreme Court in **Hussainara Khatoon v. Home Secretary, Bihar** held that a speedy trial is an integral part of Article 21\. A procedure is not "just" if an individual is kept in jail for years as an undertrial without a verdict.

*Example:* **Krishna** is arrested in **Lucknow** for a minor offense. If the trial drags on for five years while **Krishna** remains in custody, the rationale of the criminal procedure fails. To address this, the **BNSS 2023** has introduced specific timelines, such as the requirement for a judgment to be delivered within 30 days of the conclusion of arguments (Section 258).

The third pillar is the **Right to Legal Aid**. A fair trial is a myth if the accused is too poor to afford a lawyer. Under Article 21 and the directive principles, the State must provide free legal aid to those in need. If **Kanishth**, a poor laborer in **Bhopal**, is arrested and cannot afford a lawyer, the court is duty-bound to provide him with one at state expense. This ensures that **Kanishth’s** liberty is not taken away simply because of his poverty.

The fourth pillar is the **Presumption of Innocence**. The criminal procedure is built on the rationale that a person is "innocent until proven guilty." The burden of proof lies on the prosecution. This protects citizens from arbitrary arrest and conviction. If **Raghavendra** is accused of theft in **Patna**, the police officer **Laukendra** must prove the guilt "beyond reasonable doubt." Article 21 ensures that **Raghavendra** is treated with dignity during this process, prohibiting handcuffs unless absolutely necessary and barring custodial torture.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the rationale of criminal procedure is deeply rooted in the sanctity of human life and liberty as enshrined in Article 21\. The procedure laid down in the **BNSS 2023** is not merely a set of technical rules; it is the practical manifestation of the constitutional promise of "due process." Whether it is **Saurabh** being informed of his grounds of arrest in **Varanasi**, or **Satyam** receiving a speedy trial in **Jaipur**, or **Sachkeerat** getting free legal aid in **Amritsar**, the ultimate goal is to ensure that the State's "sword of justice" is tempered by the "shield of fairness." Article 21 ensures that the criminal justice system remains humane, transparent, and accountable, preventing the law from becoming an instrument of oppression.

## Q5. What is the local jurisdiction of judicial magistrates?

**Introduction**

Local jurisdiction refers to the geographical boundaries within which a court or a Magistrate is legally authorized to exercise its powers. In the criminal justice system, it is a fundamental principle that a Magistrate should ideally handle cases arising within their specified territorial limits. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the provisions regarding the local jurisdiction of Judicial Magistrates are primarily contained in **Section 12** (which corresponds to Section 14 of the old CrPC). This section ensures that judicial work is distributed systematically and that the public knows which specific court to approach for grievances. The local jurisdiction is not a fixed, unchangeable boundary; it is a flexible area defined by higher judicial authorities to ensure the effective administration of justice at the grassroots level.

**Main Body**

1\. Power to Define Limits (Section 12(1))

According to Section 12(1), the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) has the power to define the local limits of the areas within which Judicial Magistrates (appointed under Section 9 or 11\) may exercise their powers. This power is "subject to the control of the High Court." The CJM, being the head of the magistracy in the district, understands the local needs and can divide the district into various circles or areas for different Magistrates.

For instance, in the district of **Indore**, the CJM **Prateek** may define the limits of the city into North, South, and East zones. He may then assign Judicial Magistrate **Krishna** to the North zone and Judicial Magistrate **Kanishth** to the South zone. **Krishna** will then have the local jurisdiction to take cognizance of offenses occurring only in the North zone.

2\. General Rule of Extension (Section 12(2))

A crucial aspect of Section 12 is the "default" jurisdiction. If the CJM has not specifically defined or restricted the local limits for a particular Magistrate, Section 12(2) provides that the jurisdiction and powers of such a Magistrate shall extend throughout the district. This prevents a legal vacuum where an offense might fall outside any specific sub-division.

For example, if **Raghavendra** is a Judicial Magistrate in **Lucknow** and no specific area has been assigned to him by CJM **Saurabh**, then **Raghavendra** is legally competent to handle cases from any part of the Lucknow district.

3\. Sitting of Special Judicial Magistrates

The proviso to Section 12(1) clarifies that a Special Judicial Magistrate (appointed for specific cases or classes of cases) is not strictly bound by a single court building. They may hold their sittings at any place within the local area for which they are established. This is designed for convenience, especially in sensitive cases or cases involving many witnesses.

If **Laukendra** is appointed as a Special Judicial Magistrate in **Jaipur** to handle a specific case involving labor disputes, he may choose to hold court at the actual factory site in **Jaipur** if it helps the general convenience of the parties, provided it is within his local area.

4\. Jurisdiction Beyond District (Section 12(3))

Section 12(3) addresses situations where a Magistrate’s jurisdiction extends beyond the district where they ordinarily hold court. In such cases, any reference in the Sanhita to the Court of Session or the CJM shall, in relation to such a Magistrate, be understood as a reference to the Court of Session or CJM of the area within which they are exercising that jurisdiction.

Imagine **Satyam** is a Magistrate whose jurisdiction, due to a special government notification, extends to parts of both **Varanasi** and **Prayagraj**. While sitting in **Varanasi**, his administrative superior for those cases will be the CJM of Varanasi, **Sachkeerat**.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the local jurisdiction of Judicial Magistrates under the BNSS 2023 is a well-structured mechanism to ensure that judicial services are accessible and organized. By empowering the CJM to define limits under Section 12(1), the law ensures a balanced distribution of the workload. At the same time, by extending the default jurisdiction throughout the district under Section 12(2), the Sanhita ensures that no crime goes unaddressed due to a "territorial gap." For judicial officers like **Krishna** and **Kanishth**, and for the public in cities like **Bhopal** or **Patna**, these rules provide the necessary clarity on where the "power of the law" can be invoked.

## Q6. What are Executive Magistrates and Special Executive Magistrates? What is the local jurisdiction of Executive Magistrates ?

**Introduction**

The administration of criminal justice in India is divided into two distinct wings: the Judicial Magistracy and the Executive Magistracy. While Judicial Magistrates focus on the trial of offenses and the delivery of punishment, Executive Magistrates are primarily concerned with the maintenance of public order, tranquility, and the prevention of crimes. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the provisions relating to Executive Magistrates are contained in **Sections 14, 15, and 16**. These officers belong to the executive branch of the government (usually the administrative services) but are vested with specific quasi-judicial powers to handle urgent situations like unlawful assemblies, public nuisances, and the prevention of breach of peace. The rationale behind this division is to ensure that officers who are deeply connected with the local administration can act swiftly in emergencies to protect the lives and property of citizens.

**Main Body**

1\. Executive Magistrates (Section 14\)

Under Section 14 of the BNSS, the State Government has the power to appoint as many Executive Magistrates as it thinks fit in every district. One of these magistrates is designated as the District Magistrate (DM). The government may also appoint Additional District Magistrates (ADMs), who have all or any of the powers of a DM. Furthermore, the State Government may place an Executive Magistrate in charge of a sub-division, known as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM).

For example, in the district of **Lucknow**, the State Government appoints **Prateek** as the District Magistrate. **Prateek** is the administrative head of the district and is responsible for law and order. To assist him, the government appoints **Krishna** as an ADM and **Kanishth** as the SDM for a specific area like **Alambagh**. If there is a risk of a riot in **Lucknow**, **Prateek** or **Kanishth** can issue orders to disperse crowds under the preventive sections of the Sanhita.

2\. Special Executive Magistrates (Section 15\)

Section 15 provides for the appointment of Special Executive Magistrates. The State Government may appoint these for particular areas or for the performance of particular functions for a limited period. Interestingly, the BNSS has introduced a provision where the State Government can confer the powers of an Executive Magistrate on a police officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police.

Imagine that during a major festival in **Varanasi**, the local administration expects a massive influx of people. To handle the increased pressure on law and order, the government appoints **Raghavendra**, a senior retired officer or a specific official, as a Special Executive Magistrate for the duration of the festival. **Raghavendra** will have the specific powers needed to maintain peace in the crowded ghats of **Varanasi** for that specific period only. Similarly, **Laukendra**, who is a senior police officer in **Indore**, might be conferred with these powers to deal with a localized emergency efficiently.

3\. Local Jurisdiction of Executive Magistrates (Section 16\)

The geographical limits within which an Executive Magistrate can exercise their power are defined under Section 16\. The primary authority to define these limits is the District Magistrate, subject to the overall control of the State Government.

If **Prateek** (the DM) does not specifically define or restrict the area for an Executive Magistrate, Section 16(2) clarifies that their powers shall **extend throughout the district**. However, usually, a district is divided into smaller units for better governance. For instance, in **Bhopal**, the DM **Saurabh** might define that **Satyam** (an SDM) will have jurisdiction only over the **Bairagarh** sub-division, while **Sachkeerat** will handle the **Arera Colony** area. Outside these specific areas, **Satyam** and **Sachkeerat** would typically not exercise their SDM powers unless specifically authorized. This localized jurisdiction ensures that an officer is always available nearby to handle local grievances or public nuisances.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Executive Magistrates under the BNSS 2023 serve as the first line of defense for public safety. From the District Magistrate at the top to the Sub-Divisional and Special Executive Magistrates, the hierarchy is designed for administrative efficiency and rapid response. While **Prateek** oversees the entire district, officers like **Krishna** and **Kanishth** focus on specific regions, ensuring that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is provided at the local level. The clear definition of local jurisdiction under Section 16 ensures that there is no confusion regarding authority, allowing the administration in cities like **Patna** or **Jaipur** to function smoothly and prevent potential crimes before they even occur.

## Q7. Define "Public Prosecutors" and "Assistant Public Prosecutors."

**Introduction**

In the Indian criminal justice system, a crime is considered an offense not just against an individual but against the State itself. Therefore, the responsibility for prosecuting the accused lies with the State. To fulfill this duty, the State appoints legal experts known as Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, these officers are primarily governed by **Sections 18 and 19**. They are often described as "ministers of justice" because their role is not simply to secure a conviction at any cost, but to assist the court in uncovering the truth and ensuring a fair trial. They represent the public interest and act as a bridge between the police investigation and the judicial verdict. The Sanhita maintains a clear distinction between the prosecutors who appear in higher courts and those who handle matters in Magistrate courts to ensure a specialized and efficient prosecution system.

**Main Body**

1\. Public Prosecutors (Section 18\)

Section 18 of the BNSS deals with the appointment and qualifications of Public Prosecutors (PPs) and Additional Public Prosecutors. These officers represent the government in the High Courts and the Courts of Session.

* **Appointment in High Courts:** For every High Court, the Central or State Government, in consultation with that High Court, appoints a Public Prosecutor and one or more Additional Public Prosecutors. For instance, in **Prayagraj**, the Uttar Pradesh government consults with the High Court to appoint **Raghavendra** as a Public Prosecutor to handle serious appeals.  
* **Appointment in Districts:** For every district, the State Government appoints a Public Prosecutor. The District Magistrate (DM), in consultation with the Sessions Judge, prepares a panel of names of people fit for this role.  
  * *Example:* In **Lucknow**, DM **Prateek** consults with the Sessions Judge to prepare a list. From this list, **Krishna** is appointed as the Public Prosecutor for the district.  
* **Qualifications:** To be eligible for the post of a Public Prosecutor or an Additional Public Prosecutor, a person must have been in practice as an advocate for at least **seven years**.  
* **Special Public Prosecutor:** For specific high-profile cases, the government can appoint a Special PP who must have at least **ten years** of practice.  
  * *Example:* For a sensitive case in **Bhopal**, the government appoints **Laukendra**, a veteran lawyer with 15 years of experience, as a Special Public Prosecutor to ensure specialized handling.

2\. Assistant Public Prosecutors (Section 19\)

While Public Prosecutors handle the Sessions Court, Assistant Public Prosecutors (APPs) are appointed to conduct prosecutions in the Courts of Magistrates.

* **Appointment:** The State Government appoints one or more APPs in every district. In some cases, the Central Government may also appoint APPs for specific classes of cases in Magistrate courts.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh** is appointed as an Assistant Public Prosecutor in **Varanasi**. His daily job involves appearing before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, **Kanishth**, to present evidence in theft and assault cases.  
* **Police Officers as APPs:** Generally, a police officer cannot be an APP. However, Section 19(3) allows the DM to appoint a police officer as a temporary APP only if no regular APP is available. Even then, that police officer must not be below the rank of Inspector and must not have taken any part in the investigation of that specific case.  
  * *Example:* If **Saurabh** is on leave in **Varanasi**, DM **Prateek** might ask Inspector **Sachkeerat** to handle the prosecution for a day, provided **Sachkeerat** did not investigate the case involving the accused, **Satyam**.

3\. Duties and Subordination

The Public Prosecutor is an officer of the court. They must remain independent of the police. While the police gather evidence, the Prosecutor evaluates it to see if it is legally sufficient to stand in court. Under the BNSS, all Public Prosecutors and APPs are subordinate to the Director of Prosecution at the state level. This hierarchy ensures that the prosecution wing remains organized and follows uniform guidelines across cities like Jaipur or Patna.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the roles of Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors are fundamental to the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) promised by the BNSS 2023\. By setting high bars for qualifications—such as the 7-year practice requirement for **Krishna** as a PP—the law ensures that the State's side is represented by competent legal minds. At the same time, by placing APPs like **Saurabh** in Magistrate courts, the Sanhita ensures that even routine criminal matters are prosecuted professionally. The strict separation from the police investigation prevents bias, ensuring that the rights of the accused are respected while the victim's grievances are addressed. Ultimately, these officers serve the cause of justice, ensuring that the truth prevails in every courtroom from **Indore** to **Amritsar**.

## Q8. Describe the Court by which cognizable offences are trialable under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.

**Introduction**

In the criminal justice system of India, the classification of an offense as "cognizable" or "non-cognizable" is the primary factor that determines how the law is set into motion. Under **Section 2(1)(g)** of the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, a cognizable offense is one for which a police officer may arrest the accused without a warrant and can start an investigation without the prior permission of a Magistrate. Because these offenses—such as murder, rape, or theft—are generally more serious, the Sanhita provides a clear framework to determine which specific court has the authority to hear and decide these cases. The "competency to try" is not arbitrary; it is a statutory mandate that ensures a case is heard by a judge whose rank and sentencing powers are proportionate to the gravity of the crime.

**Main Body**

The determination of which court will try a cognizable offense is governed by **Section 21** of the BNSS, read in conjunction with the **First Schedule** of the Sanhita.

1\. Offences under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)

For offenses defined under the main penal law (BNS), Section 21(a) specifies three types of courts that are competent to conduct a trial:

* **The High Court:** Although it rarely conducts original trials, it has the inherent power to try any offense.  
* **The Court of Session:** Reserved for the most heinous cognizable offenses.  
* **Any other Court specified in the First Schedule:** This typically refers to the Courts of Judicial Magistrates.

2\. The Role of the First Schedule (Column 6\)

The most practical way to identify the trial court is to look at Column 6 of the First Schedule. For every offense listed, this column explicitly states "By what Court triable."

* If Column 6 says "Court of Session," the case must be tried there. For example, if **Krishna** is accused of murder in **Lucknow**, the offense is cognizable, and according to the First Schedule, it must be tried by the Court of Session.  
* If it says "Magistrate of the first class," then a JMIC will handle it. For instance, if **Prateek** is caught for a medium-scale theft in **Indore**, the First Schedule directs that a Judicial Magistrate First Class like **Saurabh** will conduct the trial.

3\. Offences under Other Laws

Section 21(b) deals with offenses created by special laws (like the NDPS Act or POCSO). If the special law mentions a specific court (e.g., "Special Court"), then that court will try the case. If no court is mentioned, the BNSS provides a default rule:

* If the offense is punishable with imprisonment for **more than three years**, it is triable by a Magistrate of the first class.  
* If punishable with **less than three years**, it can be tried by "any Magistrate."  
* *Example:* If **Kanishth** is caught in **Bhopal** violating a local environmental law that carries a 4-year sentence but doesn't name a court, Magistrate **Raghavendra** (JMIC) will have the jurisdiction to try him.

4\. Jurisdiction and Seriousness

The rationale behind this distribution is the sentencing power of the courts. Since a Magistrate of the first class can only sentence someone up to 3 years (Section 23), they cannot try a case like dacoity where the punishment might be life imprisonment. In such instances, the case is "committed" to the Sessions Court. If Laukendra is involved in an organized robbery in Jaipur, even though he is produced before a Magistrate initially, the Magistrate will recognize it as a "Sessions-triable" case and transfer it to the higher court.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the BNSS 2023 ensures that the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is upheld by matching the severity of the offense with the competence of the court. Whether it is **Satyam** facing a trial for a minor cognizable offense in **Varanasi** or **Sachkeerat** being tried for a grave offense in **Amritsar**, the law provides a predictable and transparent path through Section 21 and the First Schedule. By clearly defining which court is triable for which offense, the Sanhita prevents jurisdictional errors and ensures that the judge presiding over the case has the legal authority and the necessary seniority to deliver a just verdict.

## Q9. State the powers of the High Courts and Session Judges regarding the sentences which they may pass.

**Introduction**

The hierarchy of criminal courts in India is structured to ensure that the gravity of a crime is met with a proportionate level of judicial authority. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, defines the "Sentencing Powers" of various courts to ensure that the deprivation of an individual's liberty or life is handled by officers with appropriate seniority and experience. Among these, the High Courts and the Courts of Session hold the highest tier of authority. Under **Section 22** of the BNSS (which replaces Section 28 of the old CrPC), these courts are vested with extensive powers to pass sentences, ranging from fines to the death penalty. The rationale behind these powers is to provide the judiciary with the necessary tools to punish heinous crimes while maintaining a system of checks and balances, particularly in cases where the ultimate penalty—death—is involved.

**Main Body**

**1\. Powers of the High Court (Section 22(1))**

According to Section 22(1) of the BNSS, a High Court may pass **any sentence authorized by law**. The High Court is the highest judicial authority within a State, and its powers are not restricted by the term of imprisonment or the amount of fine it can impose, provided the punishment is recognized under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) or any other special law.

For example, if **Prateek** is found guilty of a complex multi-state financial scam in the High Court of **Prayagraj**, the High Court has the legal authority to sentence him to life imprisonment and impose an unlimited fine, provided the law for that specific offense allows such a penalty. The High Court also acts as a supervisory body, ensuring that sentences passed by lower courts are legally sound.

**2\. Powers of the Sessions Judge and Additional Sessions Judge (Section 22(2))**

The Court of Session is the primary court for trying the most serious offenses at the district level. Section 22(2) states that a **Sessions Judge** or an **Additional Sessions Judge** may pass **any sentence authorized by law**. This means they have the power to award life imprisonment or a death sentence.

However, a critical safeguard is built into the law: any **sentence of death** passed by a Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge is **subject to confirmation by the High Court**. This ensures that the most extreme punishment is reviewed by at least two higher-ranking judges before execution.

Imagine **Krishna** is a Sessions Judge in **Lucknow**. He conducts a trial for a rare and heinous murder case involving **Kanishth**. After reviewing the evidence, **Krishna** decides that the death penalty is the only appropriate punishment. While he passes the sentence, it cannot be carried out immediately. Under Section 407 of the BNSS, the proceedings must be sent to the High Court of **Prayagraj** for confirmation. Only if the High Court agrees with **Krishna’s** decision can the execution proceed.

**3\. Abolition of Assistant Sessions Judge**

A significant change in the **BNSS 2023** compared to the old CrPC is the **abolition of the post of Assistant Sessions Judge**. Under the old Code (Section 28(3)), an Assistant Sessions Judge could pass sentences of up to 10 years. In the new Sanhita, this tier has been removed to streamline the judicial process. Now, the hierarchy at the top of the district level consists strictly of the Sessions Judge and Additional Sessions Judges like **Raghavendra** or **Laukendra**, who both hold equal sentencing powers under the law.

**4\. Exercise of Discretion**

While the law grants these courts the power to pass "any sentence," this discretion must be exercised judicially. If **Saurabh**, an Additional Sessions Judge in **Indore**, finds **Satyam** guilty of a crime, he must consider the "rarest of rare" doctrine for death sentences and the principles of reformation and deterrence for imprisonment. If **Saurabh** imposes a sentence that is clearly excessive or not authorized by the BNS, the High Court can exercise its appellate or revisional powers to correct it.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the sentencing powers of the High Courts and Sessions Judges under the BNSS 2023 reflect the high degree of trust placed in the superior judiciary. By allowing the High Court to pass any sentence and the Sessions Judge to award even the death penalty (with confirmation), the Sanhita ensures that justice is served in the most serious of cases. For judicial officers like **Krishna** or **Saurabh**, these powers come with the heavy responsibility of protecting "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) while upholding the constitutional rights of the accused. The mandatory confirmation of death sentences acts as a vital "safety valve" in the Indian legal system, ensuring that no life is taken without a double layer of judicial scrutiny in cities across India, from **Bhopal** to **Amritsar**.

## Q10. State the powers of the High Court or the State Government to withdraw the powers conferred by it under the Sanhita.

**Introduction**

The authority to exercise judicial or executive power is a trust conferred by the State or the High Court to ensure the smooth functioning of the legal system. In the realm of criminal law, where the power to deprive a person of their liberty is at stake, the accountability of those exercising such power is paramount. The principle of "he who can appoint can also remove" or "he who can grant can also withdraw" is a fundamental administrative tenet. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this principle is codified in **Section 28** (which corresponds to Section 34 of the old CrPC). This section empowers the High Court and the State Government to revoke or withdraw the powers they have conferred upon various officers under the Sanhita. This ensures that if an officer becomes unfit for their role, or if the necessity for their special appointment ceases to exist, the authority can be reclaimed to prevent any potential misuse of legal power.

**Main Body**

1\. The Statutory Provision: Section 28 of BNSS

Section 28 of the BNSS provides a clear and straightforward mechanism for the withdrawal of powers. It specifies that the authority that grants a power also holds the inherent right to take it back. This applies to both judicial and executive wings of the magistracy.

* **Withdrawal by High Court:** Under Section 28(1), the High Court has the power to withdraw all or any of the powers conferred by it under this Sanhita on any person or officer subordinate to it. Since the High Court is responsible for the appointment and posting of Judicial Magistrates, it also acts as the disciplinary authority.  
  * *Example:* Imagine **Saurabh** is appointed as a Judicial Magistrate in **Indore**. If the High Court of Madhya Pradesh receives complaints regarding **Saurabh’s** conduct or finds that he is not performing his judicial duties according to the law, the High Court can issue an order under Section 28 to withdraw his judicial powers. Once this is done, **Saurabh** can no longer hear cases or pass sentences in **Indore**.  
* **Withdrawal by State Government:** Similarly, Section 28(1) empowers the State Government to withdraw powers it has conferred on officers subordinate to it. This primarily applies to Executive Magistrates and other administrative officers who are vested with powers under the Sanhita.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** is a senior administrative officer in **Lucknow**. During a period of civil unrest, the State Government confers upon him the powers of an Executive Magistrate to maintain order. Once the situation in **Lucknow** stabilizes and the "Special" requirement ends, the State Government can withdraw these powers from **Prateek** using Section 28\.

2\. Withdrawal of Powers by the District Magistrate (Section 28(2))

The law further decentralizes this power to the district level for the sake of administrative efficiency. Under Section 28(2), any power conferred by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) or by the District Magistrate (DM) may be withdrawn by the respective Magistrate who conferred it.

* **Example in Executive Magistracy:** **Raghavendra** is the District Magistrate (DM) of **Varanasi**. He confers certain local powers on **Krishna**, a Tehsildar, to act as an Executive Magistrate for a specific sub-division during a local fair. After the fair concludes, **Raghavendra** can withdraw those specific powers from **Krishna**.  
* **Example in Judicial Magistracy:** If **Laukendra**, the CJM in **Bhopal**, has delegated certain administrative judicial tasks to **Kanishth**, a junior Magistrate, **Laukendra** has the authority to withdraw those specific delegated powers whenever necessary for the better distribution of court business.

3\. Rationale and Legal Safeguards

The power to withdraw is not meant to be used arbitrarily or as a tool for political vendetta. It is a tool for Administrative Oversight. The rationale is that judicial and executive powers are "functional" in nature. If Satyam, an officer in Jaipur, is found to be incompetent or biased, the High Court or State Government must have a quick remedy to strip him of his legal authority to protect "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection). Furthermore, this section is used when "Special" appointments (like Special Judicial Magistrates or Special Executive Magistrates) are no longer required. For instance, if Sachkeerat was appointed as a Special Magistrate for a specific 6-month project in Amritsar, his powers are withdrawn under Section 28 once the project is finished.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Section 28 of the BNSS 2023 acts as a vital "check and balance" within the criminal justice hierarchy. By clearly stating that the High Court and the State Government have the power to withdraw the authority they confer, the Sanhita ensures that power remains coupled with accountability. Whether it is a Judicial Magistrate in **Indore** or an Executive Magistrate in **Varanasi**, no officer holds a permanent, irrevocable claim to these statutory powers if their conduct or the circumstances demand a withdrawal. This provision ensures that the legal machinery remains flexible, responsive, and, most importantly, staffed by individuals who are fit to uphold the dignity of the law in cities across India.

## Q11. Give the definition of complaint and explain its essentials.

**Introduction**

A "Complaint" is the legal mechanism that allows a private citizen to set the criminal law in motion directly through the judiciary, especially when the police machinery fails or refuses to act. In the Indian legal framework, a complaint acts as a formal bridge between an aggrieved individual and the Magistrate's power to take "cognizance" of an offense. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the definition and procedure for complaints have been refined to ensure that the judicial process is not misused for frivolous litigation while simultaneously protecting the rights of the victim. Unlike an FIR (First Information Report) which is filed with the police, a complaint is a judicial document submitted to a Magistrate. The rationale behind this provision is to ensure that even if the executive (police) is unresponsive, a citizen has a direct path to seek justice. The BNSS 2023 has introduced significant procedural safeguards, particularly under Section 223, making the complaint process more transparent and balanced.

**Main Body**

**1\. Definition of Complaint (Section 2(1)(h))**

According to **Section 2(1)(h)** of the BNSS, a "complaint" means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under this Sanhita, that some person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offense, but does not include a police report.

* **The Police Report Exception:** The definition clarifies that a standard police report (Charge Sheet) is not a complaint. However, there is a vital "Explanation" to this section: if a police officer investigates a case and finds that only a **non-cognizable** offense has been committed, that police report is "deemed" to be a complaint, and the police officer is "deemed" to be the complainant.  
* *Example:* **Prateek** goes to a police station in **Indore** to report a serious assault. If the police investigate and find it was only a minor non-cognizable scuffle, the report sent by Officer **Laukendra** to the Magistrate will be treated as a private complaint under Section 2(1)(h).

**2\. Essential Ingredients of a Valid Complaint**

For a statement to qualify as a legal complaint in the eyes of a Magistrate in cities like **Lucknow** or **Bhopal**, it must satisfy the following essentials:

* **Allegation of an Offense:** The complaint must contain specific facts that constitute an "offense" under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) or any other law. Mere grievances or civil disputes do not qualify.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** files a document in a **Lucknow** court stating that **Kanishth** took his money. If he doesn't allege "dishonest intention" or "cheating," the Magistrate might not treat it as a criminal complaint.  
* **Made to a Magistrate:** An allegation made to a police officer or a social worker is not a "complaint" under this Sanhita. It must be addressed specifically to a Judicial Magistrate.  
* **With a View to Action:** The person filing the complaint must intend for the Magistrate to take legal action (such as issuing a summons or warrant). A casual mention of a crime to a Judge at a social event is not a complaint.  
* **Known or Unknown Person:** The complaint can be filed even if the identity of the criminal is not known. The Magistrate has the power to order an investigation to identify the culprit.  
  * *Example:* **Raghavendra** tells a Magistrate in **Varanasi** that his house was burgled by "unknown persons." This is a valid complaint.  
* **Oral or Written:** While a written complaint is preferred for clarity, a Magistrate is legally bound to record an oral complaint.

**3\. The New "Essential" Procedure (Section 223\)**

Under the **BNSS 2023**, a new "essential" step has been added to the complaint process that was absent in the old CrPC. Under **Section 223**, a Magistrate cannot take cognizance of an offense on a complaint without giving the accused an **opportunity of being heard**. This is a revolutionary shield against false cases.

* *Example:* **Saurabh** files a private complaint against **Satyam** in **Jaipur**. Before the Magistrate **Sachkeerat** can officially start the case, he must issue a notice to **Satyam** to hear his side of the story. This ensures that **Satyam** is not unnecessarily harassed by a meritless case.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, a complaint under the BNSS 2023 is a potent tool for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), ensuring that the judicial doors remain open even when police stations might be closed to an informant. By defining a complaint as an allegation aimed at judicial action under Section 2(1)(h), the Sanhita ensures clarity in the initiation of criminal proceedings. The essentials of a complaint—ranging from the nature of the allegation to the identity of the recipient (the Magistrate)—act as filters to maintain the dignity of the court. Furthermore, the inclusion of the mandatory hearing for the accused under Section 223 reflects a modern, balanced approach to justice, where the rights of the complainant like **Krishna** are balanced with the protection of the proposed accused like **Satyam** in every district from **Amritsar** to **Patna**.

## Q12. Explain the classes of Criminal Court under B.N.S.S. 2023\. Also explain the jurisdiction in which session court and magistrate may pass the sentences?

OR

What is the court of session? How is it constituted? Give a comparative description of power of session Judge, Additional session Judge and Assistant Session Judge.

**Introduction**

The administration of criminal justice in India is organized through a hierarchical structure of courts that ensures every offense is tried by a forum appropriate to its gravity. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, which has replaced the colonial-era Code of Criminal Procedure, maintains this vital hierarchy while introducing several modernizing reforms. The "Classes of Criminal Courts" represent the different tiers of judicial authority, ranging from the High Court at the state level to the Magistrates at the local level. The rationale behind this classification is to provide a systematic approach to justice, where more complex and serious crimes are handled by senior judges with broader sentencing powers, while less severe matters are resolved quickly by the lower magistracy. This division of labor not only manages the massive caseload of the Indian judiciary but also ensures that the "Nagarik Suraksha" or protection of citizens is upheld through a transparent and accountable legal framework.

**Main Body**

According to **Section 6** of the **BNSS 2023**, besides the High Courts and the Supreme Court, there shall be four distinct classes of criminal courts in every State: the **Court of Session**, **Judicial Magistrates of the First Class**, **Judicial Magistrates of the Second Class**, and **Executive Magistrates**.

The **Court of Session** is the highest criminal court in a district. Under **Section 8**, the State Government establishes this court for every sessions division, and the High Court appoints the presiding Judge. A significant change in the **BNSS 2023** is the abolition of the post of Assistant Sessions Judge. Previously, under the old CrPC, there were three types of judges in this court: the Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions Judges, and Assistant Sessions Judges. Now, the hierarchy consists only of the **Sessions Judge** and **Additional Sessions Judges**. For example, in the district of **Bhopal**, **Saurabh** is appointed as the Sessions Judge. To manage the workload, **Raghavendra** is appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. Both **Saurabh** and **Raghavendra** exercise the same judicial and sentencing powers.

Regarding the **jurisdiction to pass sentences**, **Section 22** provides that a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge may pass any sentence authorized by law. This includes life imprisonment and the death penalty. However, any death sentence passed by **Saurabh** in **Bhopal** must be confirmed by the High Court before it is executed. In the old system, an Assistant Sessions Judge could only sentence up to ten years; by removing this middle tier, the BNSS has streamlined the process, ensuring that serious trials are handled by judges with full sentencing authority.

Below the Court of Session are the **Judicial Magistrates**. At the head of the magistracy in a district is the **Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM)**. Under **Section 23**, a CJM has the power to pass any sentence authorized by law except a sentence of death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a term exceeding seven years. Imagine **Prateek** is the CJM in **Lucknow**. He can sentence an offender to six years in prison and impose an unlimited fine, but if the crime warrants a ten-year sentence, he must commit the case to the Sessions Court.

The **Judicial Magistrate of the First Class (JMIC)** follows the CJM. Under the BNSS, a JMIC like **Krishna** in **Indore** may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding **three years**, or a fine not exceeding **fifty thousand rupees**, or both. It is important to note that the fine limit has been increased from ten thousand in the old law to fifty thousand in the BNSS to reflect modern economic realities. Finally, the **Judicial Magistrate of the Second Class** like **Kanishth** in **Varanasi** may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding **one year**, or a fine not exceeding **ten thousand rupees**, or both.

The hierarchy is completed by **Executive Magistrates**, such as **Laukendra** in **Jaipur**, who primarily handle matters of public order and tranquility rather than conducting trials for punishments. If a conflict arises between **Satyam** and **Sachkeerat** regarding a property dispute in **Patna** that might lead to a riot, **Laukendra** as an Executive Magistrate can intervene using preventive powers, but he cannot sentence them to prison for a crime like a Judicial Magistrate would.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the classes of criminal courts under the **BNSS 2023** provide a clear and efficient roadmap for the delivery of justice. By categorizing courts from the Sessions Judge down to the Magistrate of the Second Class, the Sanhita ensures that judicial expertise is utilized proportionately to the crime's impact on society. The abolition of the Assistant Sessions Judge and the increase in fine limits for Magistrates are proof of a system evolving to meet contemporary needs. Whether it is **Saurabh** presiding over a major trial in **Bhopal** or **Krishna** handling a theft case in **Indore**, these jurisdictional boundaries ensure that power is exercised within legal limits. This structured hierarchy remains the backbone of the Indian criminal justice system, ensuring that the promise of a fair and speedy trial is fulfilled for every citizen in every corner of the country.

## Q13. Discuss the Constitution and powers of Criminal Courts.

**Introduction**

The administration of criminal justice in any civilized society requires a robust, structured, and hierarchical system of courts. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, which has replaced the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, provides the comprehensive legal framework for the constitution and powers of these courts in India. The primary objective of this hierarchy is to ensure that the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is not just a theoretical concept but a practical reality. By establishing different classes of courts, the law ensures that judicial resources are allocated based on the complexity and gravity of the offense. This structure prevents the concentration of power in a single authority and provides a system of checks and balances through appeals and revisions. The BNSS has modernized this constitution by streamlining the types of courts, removing colonial remnants like the "Metropolitan" distinction, and enhancing the sentencing and financial powers of the lower judiciary to reflect contemporary needs.

**Main Body**

According to **Section 6** of the BNSS 2023, the criminal judicial landscape of every State consists of the High Court and four specific classes of criminal courts: the **Court of Session**, **Judicial Magistrates of the First Class**, **Judicial Magistrates of the Second Class**, and **Executive Magistrates**.

The **Court of Session** stands at the apex of the district-level judiciary. Under **Section 8**, the State Government establishes a Court of Session for every sessions division, which usually corresponds to a district. The High Court appoints a Sessions Judge and may also appoint Additional Sessions Judges. A significant change in the BNSS is the removal of the post of Assistant Sessions Judge, which existed in the old CrPC. This leaves the Sessions Judge and Additional Sessions Judges as the primary authorities for serious trials.

*Example:* In **Lucknow**, **Prateek** is appointed as the Sessions Judge. Due to a high volume of cases, the High Court also appoints **Krishna** as an Additional Sessions Judge. Both have the same powers to try heinous crimes like murder or dacoity.

Below the sessions level are the **Judicial Magistrates**. Under **Section 9**, the State Government, in consultation with the High Court, establishes courts of First Class and Second Class Magistrates. Every district has a **Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM)** who acts as the administrative head of the magistracy.

*Example:* **Kanishth** is the CJM in **Indore**, while **Raghavendra** is a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class (JMIC). **Raghavendra** is subordinate to **Kanishth**, who handles the distribution of cases among all Magistrates in the district.

The **powers of these courts to pass sentences** are defined under **Sections 22 and 23**. The High Court and the Sessions Judge/Additional Sessions Judge may pass any sentence authorized by law. However, a death sentence passed by a Sessions Judge must be confirmed by the High Court. The CJM can pass any sentence except death, life imprisonment, or a term exceeding seven years. The JMIC, like **Laukendra** in **Bhopal**, can now sentence an offender to up to three years or a fine up to **fifty thousand rupees** (an increase from ten thousand). The Second Class Magistrate, like **Saurabh** in **Jaipur**, can sentence up to one year or a fine up to ten thousand rupees. A new form of punishment introduced by the BNSS is **"Community Service,"** which can be awarded by Magistrates for petty offenses.

**Executive Magistrates** form the non-judicial wing of the hierarchy. Governed by **Section 14**, the State Government appoints a **District Magistrate (DM)** and several Additional or Sub-divisional Magistrates. Their role is focused on the maintenance of public order and preventive action rather than conducting trials for punishment.

*Example:* In **Varanasi**, **Satyam** is the DM. When a dispute over land arises between two groups that might lead to violence, **Satyam** uses his powers under Section 164 to intervene. If the situation is urgent, he might appoint **Sachkeerat**, a senior police officer, as a **Special Executive Magistrate** under Section 15 to handle the crisis.

The **subordination of courts** (Sections 13 and 20\) ensures a clear chain of command. All Judicial Magistrates are subordinate to the CJM, who is in turn subordinate to the Sessions Judge. Similarly, Executive Magistrates are subordinate to the DM. This ensures that the judicial process in cities like **Patna** or **Amritsar** remains organized, and any person aggrieved by an order has a clear path for appeal to a higher authority.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the constitution and powers of criminal courts under the **BNSS 2023** provide a sophisticated and balanced mechanism for the administration of justice. By clearly defining the roles and sentencing limits of each class of court—from the High Court down to the Magistrate of the Second Class—the Sanhita ensures that the legal system is both accessible and authoritative. The modernization of fine limits and the introduction of community service show that the law is adapting to the 21st century. Whether it is **Prateek** presiding over a serious trial in **Lucknow** or **Saurabh** handling a minor matter in **Jaipur**, the structured hierarchy guarantees that every "Nagarik" (citizen) is treated according to a "procedure established by law." This system remains the greatest safeguard for public tranquility and individual liberty in the Indian republic.

Or  
~~What are the different provisions of arrest under B.N.S.S. 2023? Explain.~~

**Introduction**

The concept of "Arrest" is the most significant tool in the hands of the State to ensure the administration of justice and the maintenance of public order. In legal terms, although the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023** does not provide a formal definition of "Arrest," it is understood as the act of depriving a person of their liberty by legal authority. It is a process where a person is taken into custody to answer an alleged crime or to prevent the commission of one. The rationale behind arrest is to ensure that the accused is available for investigation and trial, to prevent the destruction of evidence, and to protect the community. The BNSS 2023 has refined the laws regarding arrest to balance the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) with the fundamental rights of the individual, ensuring that no person is deprived of liberty without a "just, fair, and reasonable" procedure.

**Main Body**

**1\. Who Can Make an Arrest?**

Under the BNSS 2023, the power to arrest is not limited to police officers alone. The law recognizes three categories of persons who can effect an arrest:

* **Police Officer:** The most common authority, empowered under Sections 35 and 44\.  
* **Private Person:** Under Section 40, a private citizen can arrest a person who commits a non-bailable and cognizable offense in their presence, or a proclaimed offender.  
* **Magistrate:** Under Section 41, any Magistrate (Judicial or Executive) can arrest an offender if a crime is committed in their presence within their local jurisdiction.

**2\. How is an Arrest Made? (Section 43\)**

According to Section 43, an arrest consists of the actual seizure or touching of the body of the person to be arrested. However, if the person voluntarily submits to custody by word or action, no physical touching is required. If the person forcibly resists, the officer may use "all means necessary" to effect the arrest.

* **Example:** **Saurabh**, a police officer in **Bhopal**, tells **Prateek**, "You are under arrest for theft." If **Prateek** says, "I am coming with you," and walks to the jeep, the arrest is complete. If **Prateek** runs, **Saurabh** can physically catch and confine him.

**3\. Arrest Without a Warrant (Section 35\)**

A police officer can arrest without a warrant in several specific circumstances:

* If the person commits a cognizable offense in the presence of the officer.  
* Against whom a reasonable complaint or credible information exists regarding a cognizable offense (subject to the 7-year rule for mandatory notice).  
* If the person is a proclaimed offender.  
* If found in possession of stolen property.  
* If the person obstructs a police officer in the execution of duty or has escaped from lawful custody.  
* **Example:** **Krishna** is caught by Officer **Raghavendra** in **Lucknow** while trying to break into a shop. Since this is a cognizable offense in his presence, **Raghavendra** arrests **Krishna** immediately without a warrant.

**4\. Pursuit into Another Jurisdiction (Section 48\)**

Section 48 of the BNSS grants police officers the power of "hot pursuit." A police officer may, for the purpose of arresting without a warrant any person whom he is authorized to arrest, pursue such person into any place in India. This ensures that state or district boundaries do not become a shield for criminals.

* **Example:** Officer **Laukendra** in **Indore** is chasing **Kanishth**, who has committed a robbery. **Kanishth** crosses the border into **Rajasthan**. Under Section 48, **Laukendra** can continue his pursuit and arrest **Kanishth** in **Jaipur** without needing a fresh warrant from the Rajasthan authorities.

**5\. Different Provisions under BNSS 2023 (Sections 35–62)**

The BNSS has introduced several key safeguards and procedures:

* **Section 35(3):** Mandatory notice for offenses punishable with less than 7 years.  
* **Section 36:** Duty of the arresting officer to bear visible identification and prepare an "Arrest Memorandum" witnessed by a family member or local resident.  
* **Section 43(5):** Protection for women—no woman can be arrested after sunset or before sunrise except in exceptional circumstances with a Magistrate’s order.  
* **Section 47:** Right of the arrested person to be informed of the grounds of arrest and the right to bail.  
* **Section 58:** Mandatory production before a Magistrate within 24 hours.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions of arrest under the **BNSS 2023** serve as a vital mechanism for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) while upholding the constitutional mandate of Article 21\. By clearly defining who can arrest and how it must be conducted—as seen in the case of **Saurabh** and **Prateek**—the Sanhita removes ambiguity from the process. The power of pursuit under Section 48 ensures that criminals like **Kanishth** cannot evade the law by crossing borders. Ultimately, the BNSS 2023 ensures that while the State has the power to arrest, it must do so with transparency, following a strict "procedure established by law" that respects the dignity and rights of every citizen in every corner of India, from **Patna** to **Amritsar**.

## Q2. (a) Can a private person arrest another person? If so, what is the procedure? (b) When can a Magistrate arrest?

**Introduction**

While the primary duty of maintaining law and order rests with the State, the law recognizes that there are exceptional situations where a police officer may not be immediately available. In such crises, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023** empowers ordinary citizens and Magistrates to act as protectors of society. The "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) philosophy of the new Sanhita is reflected in **Section 40** (arrest by a private person) and **Section 41** (arrest by a Magistrate). These provisions ensure that a criminal does not escape justice simply because of the temporary absence of a police uniform. However, because these powers involve the serious matter of depriving a person of their liberty, the BNSS prescribes a strict "procedure established by law" to prevent vigilantism and ensure that the arrested person is integrated into the formal legal system as quickly as possible.

**Main Body**

**1\. Arrest by a Private Person: Scope and Procedure (Section 40\)**

Under Section 40 of the BNSS, a private citizen is granted a limited but powerful right to effect an arrest. This right is not general; it applies only under two specific conditions:

* **Cognizable and Non-Bailable Offense:** The person must commit a serious crime (like murder, dacoity, or rape) in the "presence" of the private individual.  
* **Proclaimed Offender:** The person being arrested must be someone who has been officially declared a "proclaimed offender" by a court.

Procedure for Private Arrest:

Once a private person like Prateek decides to arrest an offender like Krishna in Lucknow, he must follow the statutory procedure:

* **Immediate Action:** **Prateek** must take **Krishna** into custody without unnecessary delay.  
* **Six-Hour Rule (New in BNSS):** A significant update in the BNSS is the introduction of a strict timeline. **Prateek** must hand over **Krishna** to a police officer or take him to the nearest police station within **six hours** of the arrest.  
* **Police Re-Arrest:** Upon receiving the person, the police officer must check if the individual falls under the categories of arrestable persons under Section 35\. If there is reason to believe the person committed a cognizable offense, the police will officially "take them into custody."  
* **Refusal of Details:** If **Krishna** has committed only a non-cognizable offense and refuses to give his name or residence to the police, he will be dealt with under Section 39 (arrest on refusal to give name).  
* **Release:** If there is no sufficient reason to believe that **Krishna** has committed any offense, he must be released immediately.

*Example:* In a busy market in **Indore**, **Saurabh** sees **Kanishth** snatching a gold chain (a cognizable and non-bailable offense). **Saurabh** and other shoppers catch **Kanishth**. Under Section 40, **Saurabh** must take **Kanishth** to the **Indore** local police station within six hours to complete the legal process.

**2\. Arrest by a Magistrate: Scope and Procedure (Section 41\)**

A Magistrate, being a judicial officer, has broader powers than a private citizen but narrower than a police officer. Section 41 of the BNSS (which replaces Section 44 of the old CrPC) provides two scenarios for such an arrest:

* **Offense in Presence (Section 41(1)):** When any offense (cognizable or non-cognizable) is committed in the presence of a Magistrate (Judicial or Executive) within their **local jurisdiction**, the Magistrate may himself arrest or order any person to arrest the offender.  
* **Competence to Issue Warrant (Section 41(2)):** A Magistrate can arrest, or direct the arrest of, any person for whose arrest they are competent to issue a warrant at that time and under those circumstances.

*Example:* While **Raghavendra**, a Judicial Magistrate, is walking through a park in **Varanasi**, he witnesses **Satyam** brutally assaulting a passerby. Since the offense happened in his "presence" and "jurisdiction," **Raghavendra** can personally arrest **Satyam** or order his security guard, **Laukendra**, to do so. After the arrest, **Raghavendra** will commit **Satyam** to custody, subject to bail provisions.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions of Sections 40 and 41 of the BNSS 2023 ensure that the machinery of justice is always "on duty." By allowing a private person like **Saurabh** to arrest a criminal in an emergency, the law encourages civic responsibility. By empowering a Magistrate like **Raghavendra** to act as an arresting authority, the Sanhita ensures that judicial oversight begins at the very moment of the crime. The new "six-hour rule" for private arrests is a vital safeguard that prevents illegal detention and ensures that citizens remain assistants to the law, not a law unto themselves. These procedures collectively uphold the sanctity of Article 21, ensuring that every arrest made in **Jaipur**, **Patna**, or **Amritsar** is rooted in a transparent and accountable legal framework.

---

## Q3. ~~(a) What is Arrest? How is it made ?~~ (b) Is there any protection to the members of Armed Forces from arrest?

**Introduction**

Arrest is a fundamental concept in criminal jurisprudence, representing the formal deprivation of an individual's liberty by legal authority. While the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023** does not provide a strict dictionary-style definition of "Arrest," it is judicially understood as the physical restraint or seizure of a person to answer for an alleged offense or to prevent the commission of a crime. It is a critical stage that transitions a person from a state of freedom to legal custody. The rationale behind arrest is to ensure the presence of the accused during investigation and trial, to prevent the destruction of evidence, and to maintain public safety. Under the BNSS 2023, the process of "how" an arrest is made is codified to ensure that force is used proportionately and that the dignity of the individual is respected, even while the law is being enforced. Furthermore, the Sanhita recognizes that certain categories of persons, such as the members of the Armed Forces, require special legal protection to ensure that their official duties are not obstructed by frivolous or malicious legal actions.

**Main Body**

**1\. How is an Arrest Made? (Section 43\)**

Section 43 of the BNSS (corresponding to Section 46 of the old CrPC) provides the specific procedure for effecting an arrest. It outlines a hierarchy of physical and verbal actions:

* **Submission to Custody:** The primary method of arrest is "submission." If the person to be arrested submits to the custody of the officer by word or action, the arrest is legally complete. No physical force or touching is required in such cases.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek**, a police officer in **Indore**, informs **Krishna** that he is under arrest for a hit-and-run case. **Krishna** says, "I understand," and sits in the police vehicle. The arrest is complete without **Prateek** ever touching **Krishna**.  
* **Touching or Confining:** If the person does not submit, the arresting officer must actually touch or confine the body of the person to be arrested.  
* **Use of Force (Section 43(2)):** If the person forcibly resists the arrest or attempts to evade it, the officer may use "all means necessary" to effect the arrest. However, Section 43(4) clarifies that this does not grant a right to cause the death of a person who is not accused of an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment.  
* **Handcuffs (Section 43(3) \- New Provision):** A significant update in the BNSS is the explicit power to use handcuffs. An officer may use handcuffs based on the nature and gravity of the offense if the person is a habitual offender, a repeat offender, an escapee, or involved in serious crimes like organized crime, terrorist acts, drug crimes, murder, or rape.  
  * *Example:* **Raghavendra** arrests **Kanishth** in **Lucknow** for a multi-state drug trafficking operation. Given the gravity of the offense, **Raghavendra** uses handcuffs while taking **Kanishth** to the station.  
* **Arrest of Women (Section 43(5)):** The Sanhita reinforces that a woman can only be arrested by a female police officer. Except in "exceptional circumstances" and with the prior permission of a Magistrate, no woman shall be arrested after sunset and before sunrise.

**2\. Protection to Members of Armed Forces (Section 42\)**

Section 42 of the BNSS (old Section 45\) provides a statutory shield to the members of the Armed Forces of the Union (Army, Navy, Air Force, and certain paramilitary forces).

* **Immunity for Official Duty:** No member of the Armed Forces can be arrested for anything done or "purported to be done" by them in the discharge of their official duties.  
* **Requirement of Consent:** For such an arrest to be legal, the Central Government must provide its prior consent. This protection ensures that soldiers and officers are not harassed by local legal proceedings while performing national security tasks.  
* **State Government Powers:** The State Government can also extend this protection to local police forces charged with maintaining public order through a notification.  
  * *Example:* **Saurabh**, a member of the Armed Forces, is deployed in **Srinagar** to control a riot. During the operation, he takes actions that lead to a complaint by a local citizen. Officer **Laukendra** in **Srinagar** cannot arrest **Saurabh** without the formal consent of the Central Government, as **Saurabh** was acting in the line of duty.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the BNSS 2023 provides a balanced approach to the concept of arrest. By defining the procedure in Section 43, it ensures that officers like **Prateek** or **Raghavendra** know exactly how to secure a suspect like **Krishna** or **Kanishth** without infringing upon their dignity unnecessarily. The introduction of specific rules for handcuffs and women's arrests reflects a modern understanding of security and human rights. Simultaneously, Section 42 acts as a vital protection for the defenders of the nation, ensuring that officers like **Saurabh** can perform their duties in places like **Amritsar** or **Guwahati** without the constant threat of arbitrary arrest. These provisions together uphold the "rationale of criminal procedure" as mandated by Article 21, ensuring that every curtailment of liberty is rooted in a procedure that is just and transparent.

## Q4. Answer the following

1. Is it a right of a person arrested to be informed on grounds of arrest and of right to bail?  
2. Can an arrested person claim his examination by a medical practitioner after his arrest?  
3. Can a registered medical practitioner examine an arrested person at the request of a police officer? If so, under what circumstances?

**Introduction**

The hallmark of a civilized criminal justice system is the protection of the rights of those whom the State seeks to deprive of their liberty. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, in harmony with Article 22 of the Constitution of India, establishes a robust framework of safeguards for arrested persons. These safeguards are not mere procedural formalities; they are substantive rights intended to prevent arbitrary detention and custodial abuse. The rationale behind these provisions is to ensure that the "power of the sword" held by the police is always tempered by the "shield of the law." Whether it is the right to know why one is being detained, the right to seek freedom through bail, or the right to have one's physical integrity verified by a medical professional, the BNSS ensures that the transition from a free citizen to an arrested person is governed by transparency and dignity. For individuals like **Prateek** or **Krishna**, these rights are the first line of defense against potential state overreach.

**Main Body**

**1\. Right to be Informed of Grounds of Arrest and Right to Bail (Section 47\)**

Under **Section 47** of the BNSS (corresponding to Section 50 of the old CrPC), every police officer or other person arresting any person without a warrant is legally bound to "forthwith communicate" the full particulars of the offense or other grounds for such arrest. This is a mandatory statutory requirement that mirrors the constitutional mandate under Article 22(1). The purpose is to allow the arrested person to understand the allegations, consult a lawyer, and prepare a defense.

Furthermore, Section 47(2) mandates that if the offense is bailable, the officer must inform the person that they are entitled to be released on bail and that they may arrange for sureties.

*Example:* **Raghavendra**, a police officer in **Lucknow**, arrests **Kanishth** for a minor brawl. **Raghavendra** must immediately tell **Kanishth**, "You are being arrested for a bailable offense under the Sanhita, and you have the right to be released on bail right now if you provide a surety." If **Raghavendra** fails to do this, the arrest itself may be deemed illegal by a court in **Lucknow**.

**2\. Right of Arrested Person to Claim Medical Examination (Section 53\)**

The BNSS provides the arrested person with a specific right to verify their physical condition. Under **Section 53** (old Section 54), when an arrested person alleges, either at the time of being produced before a Magistrate or during custody, that an examination of their body will afford evidence disproving the crime or showing they were subjected to torture, the Magistrate must direct a medical examination.

This right is a vital protection against custodial violence. If **Saurabh** is arrested in **Bhopal** and feels he has been mistreated in the lock-up, he can demand a medical check-up. The medical officer will record any injuries or marks of violence, and a copy of this report must be furnished to **Saurabh** or his nominee, like **Satyam**. This record serves as "contemporaneous evidence" if **Saurabh** later files a complaint against the police.

**3\. Medical Examination at the Request of a Police Officer (Section 51\)**

The Sanhita also empowers the police to seek a medical examination of the accused to aid the investigation. Under **Section 51** (old Section 53), if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such an examination will afford evidence as to the commission of the offense, it is lawful for a registered medical practitioner to examine the person.

A key update in the **BNSS 2023** is that **any police officer** can now make this request, whereas the old law required an officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector. The "examination" under this section is broad and includes blood tests, DNA profiling, and other modern scientific techniques.

*Example:* In **Varanasi**, **Laukendra** is arrested on suspicion of a serious assault. Officer **Sachkeerat** believes a DNA sample from **Laukendra**'s clothes will prove his presence at the crime scene. **Sachkeerat** can request a medical practitioner to perform this examination. If **Laukendra** is a female, the examination must be conducted only by, or under the supervision of, a female medical practitioner to protect her modesty and dignity.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions of the **BNSS 2023** regarding information and medical examination represent a balanced approach to criminal justice. By mandating the disclosure of arrest grounds and bail rights under Section 47, the law ensures that citizens like **Kanishth** are not kept in the dark about their legal status. By providing for medical examinations under Sections 51 and 53, the Sanhita uses science to both assist the investigation by officers like **Sachkeerat** and protect the human rights of suspects like **Saurabh**. These rights together ensure that the procedure for depriving a person of liberty in cities across India—from **Amritsar** to **Patna**—remains "just, fair, and reasonable" as required by Article 21 of the Constitution.

## 5 (a) How long a person arrested can be detained in custody by a police officer without warrant? (b) Describe the powers to pursue and retake the person on his escape.

**Introduction**

The restriction of a person's liberty by the police is a serious matter that is strictly regulated by the Constitution and the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**. The fundamental principle of Indian criminal law is that no person should be detained in police custody for a moment longer than is strictly necessary. The "24-hour rule" is a constitutional and statutory mandate designed to prevent custodial torture, extract forced confessions, and ensure that the judiciary—not the police—decides the fate of an arrested person. Furthermore, the Sanhita recognizes that the process of arrest is not always easy; if a person escapes from legal custody, the law provides the authorities with the power of "hot pursuit" to retake them. These provisions ensure that while the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is maintained by catching offenders, the individual's right against arbitrary detention is protected under the oversight of a Magistrate.

**Main Body**

**1\. Duration of Detention Without a Warrant (Section 58\)**

According to **Section 58** of the BNSS (which corresponds to Section 57 of the old CrPC), no police officer shall detain in custody a person arrested without a warrant for a longer period than is "reasonable" under all the circumstances of the case.

Crucially, the law sets a strict upper limit: such a period shall not, in the absence of a special order of a Magistrate under Section 187, exceed **twenty-four hours**. This 24-hour period excludes the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate's Court.

* **The Rationale:** This rule ensures that the arrested person is produced before a judicial mind as soon as possible. The Magistrate then evaluates if there is a *prima facie* case to keep the person in further custody (Police Custody or Judicial Custody).  
* **Example:** **Prateek** is arrested by Officer **Saurabh** in **Indore** at 10:00 AM on a Monday. By 10:00 AM on Tuesday, **Saurabh** must produce **Prateek** before a Magistrate in **Indore**. If the court is 2 hours away, the police get those 2 extra hours for travel. If **Saurabh** keeps **Prateek** for 30 hours without a Magistrate's order, the detention becomes illegal, and **Saurabh** may face legal action.

**2\. Powers to Pursue and Retake on Escape (Section 62\)**

Legal custody is not a suggestion; it is a mandate. If a person who is in lawful custody escapes or is rescued, the law provides the authorities with the power of immediate pursuit. Under **Section 62** (old Section 60), the person from whose custody he escaped or was rescued may **immediately pursue and arrest him in any place in India**.

* **Scope of Power:** This power is not just limited to the police. If a private person like **Krishna** had arrested a thief and the thief escaped, **Krishna** has the legal right to pursue and retake him.  
* **Procedures of Arrest Apply:** Section 62(2) clarifies that when retaking an escaped person, the provisions of Section 43 (How arrest is made) shall apply. This means the officer or person can use necessary force to catch the escapee, and if the escapee is a woman, the protections regarding female arrest still apply.  
* **Example:** **Kanishth** is arrested in **Lucknow** and is being taken to court. He pushes the officer and runs away, eventually crossing into the neighboring district of **Kanpur**. Officer **Raghavendra** does not need a new warrant or permission from Kanpur police to catch him. Under Section 62, **Raghavendra** can pursue **Kanishth** into **Kanpur**, or even to **Patna** or **Jaipur**, and retake him into custody immediately.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the **BNSS 2023** creates a disciplined framework for police conduct. By enforcing the 24-hour rule under Section 58, the law upholds the "rationale of criminal procedure" as dictated by Article 21 and 22 of the Constitution, ensuring that individuals like **Prateek** are protected from prolonged and unauthorized police detention. At the same time, Section 62 ensures that the law is not mocked by those who attempt to flee from justice. Whether it is a police officer in **Lucknow** producing a suspect on time or an officer in **Indore** pursuing an escapee across state lines, these provisions ensure that "Nagarik Suraksha" is balanced with the rule of law. The judicial oversight provided at the end of the 24-hour window remains the greatest safeguard against the misuse of executive power in the Indian legal system.

## Q6. (a) Discuss the general provisions of search under B.N.S.S. (b) How the things found in search beyond jurisdiction are disposed of?

**Introduction**

A "Search" is a procedural tool used by law enforcement to discover evidence, stolen property, or persons wrongfully confined. While it is an essential power for the administration of justice, it is also a significant intrusion into the privacy of a citizen. Therefore, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023** provides a strict framework to ensure that searches are conducted with transparency and accountability. The rationale behind these provisions is to prevent the "planting" of evidence and to ensure that the material collected can stand the test of a judicial trial. One of the most revolutionary changes in the BNSS 2023 is the mandatory requirement for audio-video recording of the search process, which directly supports the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) objective by reducing allegations of police high-handedness.

**Main Body**

**1\. General Provisions of Search (Sections 103, 105, and 185\)**

The general rules for conducting a search are designed to be fair and transparent. Under **Section 103** (old Section 100), the following procedures must be followed:

* **Free Ingress (Entry):** Any person in charge of a "closed place" (like a house or warehouse) must allow the officer free entry upon the production of a warrant. If entry is refused, the officer may use force to break open doors or windows.  
* **Presence of Witnesses:** Before starting the search, the officer must call upon **two or more independent and respectable inhabitants** of the locality to witness the process. These are commonly known as "Panch" witnesses.  
* **Preparation of List (Seizure Memo):** A list of all things seized and the places where they were found must be prepared. This list (Panchanama) must be signed by the witnesses. A copy of this list must be delivered to the occupant of the place.  
* **Search of Person:** If a person at the scene is suspected of concealing an item, they may be searched. If the person is a woman, the search must be conducted by another woman with strict regard to decency.

**Mandatory Videography (Section 105):**

A major salient feature of the BNSS 2023 is that the entire process of search and seizure, including the preparation and signing of the list by witnesses, shall be recorded through any audio-video electronic means, preferably by a mobile phone. This recording must be forwarded to the Magistrate without delay.

* *Example:* **Saurabh**, a police officer in **Indore**, conducts a search of **Satyam's** house for stolen jewelry. He must call two neighbors, say **Prateek** and **Krishna**, to witness it. **Saurabh** must use his smartphone to video-record the entire process—from entering the house to finding the jewelry and getting **Prateek's** signature on the list.

**2\. Search Beyond Jurisdiction (Section 186\)**

Sometimes, an investigation in one city requires a search in another. Under **Section 186** (old Section 166), two methods are provided:

* **Search via Request:** An officer in charge of a police station in **Lucknow** (like **Raghavendra**) can require the officer in charge of a station in **Varanasi** (like **Laukendra**) to cause a search to be made in the latter’s jurisdiction. **Laukendra** will then conduct the search following the rules of Section 185 and forward the items found to **Raghavendra**.  
* **Personal Pursuit in Urgency:** If **Raghavendra** believes that the time taken to request **Laukendra** will result in the evidence being destroyed, he can personally conduct the search in **Varanasi**.

**3\. Disposal of Things Found Beyond Jurisdiction**

When a search is conducted outside the officer's own jurisdiction, the "disposal" or handling of seized items follows a specific legal path under Section 186:

* **Forwarding to Requesting Officer:** If the local police conducted the search on request, they must immediately forward the seized items and the seizure list to the officer who made the request.  
* **Reporting to Local Authorities:** If an officer (like **Raghavendra**) conducts a search personally in another jurisdiction (like **Varanasi**), he must "forthwith" send a notice of the search and a copy of the seizure list to the officer in charge of the local police station (**Laukendra**).  
* **Magisterial Oversight:** He must also send a copy of the list and the reasons for the search to the **nearest Magistrate** empowered to take cognizance of the offense. This ensures that the local judiciary is aware of the search happening in its territory.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the general provisions of search under the **BNSS 2023** strike a delicate balance between the State's power to investigate and the citizen's right to privacy. By mandating the presence of independent witnesses like **Prateek** and the use of modern technology through Section 105, the law minimizes the chances of false evidence. The rules for search beyond jurisdiction under Section 186 ensure that the "long arm of the law" can reach criminals like **Kanishth** in **Jaipur** while still respecting the administrative and judicial boundaries of different districts. Whether it is **Saurabh** in **Indore** or **Sachkeerat** in **Amritsar**, every officer must follow these "just, fair, and reasonable" procedures to ensure that the evidence collected is legally valid and that "Nagarik Suraksha" is truly upheld.

## Q7. When the proclamation for persons, absconding shall be published? Can a warrant of arrest and proclamation be issued simultaneously? Who is a proclaimed offender? Discuss the law about declaring an accused to be a proclaimed offender. What is the status of a proclaimed offender in the eyes of law? Explain.

**Introduction**

A "Proclamation" is a formal public announcement made by a court when its ordinary process—the warrant of arrest—has failed to secure the presence of an accused. In the criminal justice system, if an individual like **Prateek** chooses to defy the law by hiding or running away, the court does not remain helpless. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, specifically **Section 84**, the court can escalate its process to a public declaration. The rationale behind this is twofold: first, to exert social and legal pressure on the absconder to surrender, and second, to lay the legal groundwork for more severe consequences, such as the attachment of property or even a trial in absentia. The BNSS 2023 has significantly widened the scope of who can be declared a "Proclaimed Offender," moving away from the limited list of the old CrPC to include any person accused of an offense punishable by 10 years or more, life imprisonment, or death.

**Main Body**

**1\. When is a Proclamation Published? (Section 84(1))**

A court can publish a written proclamation if it has "reason to believe" that a person against whom a warrant has been issued has:

* **Absconded:** Left their usual place of residence to avoid the law.  
* Concealed themselves: Hiding within their own house or locality so that the warrant cannot be executed.  
  The proclamation must require the person to appear at a specified place and time, which must be not less than thirty days from the date of publishing the proclamation.

**2\. Procedure for Publication (Section 84(2))**

The law ensures that the proclamation reaches the ears of the absconder through multiple channels:

* **Public Reading:** It must be read out loud in a conspicuous place in the town or village where the person ordinarily resides.  
* **Affixture:** A copy must be pasted on a conspicuous part of the person's house or homestead.  
* **Court House:** A copy must be displayed on the notice board of the Court-house.  
* **Newspaper:** If the Court thinks fit, it can also order the proclamation to be published in a daily newspaper circulating in that area.  
* *Example:* If **Krishna** absconds from **Lucknow**, the Court will ensure the notice is read at the local market, pasted on **Krishna's** door in **Lucknow**, and put on the Court's board.

**3\. Simultaneous Issuance of Warrant and Proclamation?**

Generally, a proclamation is the next step after a warrant fails. However, the law and judicial precedents allow for simultaneous action in exceptional cases. If the Court is satisfied that the accused is about to dispose of their property or flee the country, it can issue the proclamation along with the warrant to save time. In the BNSS 2023, the link between proclamation and property attachment has been made even tighter to ensure "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection).

**4\. Who is a Proclaimed Offender? (Section 84(4))**

Under the BNSS 2023, the definition of a "Proclaimed Offender" (PO) has been broadened.

* **The Criteria:** If a person is accused of an offense punishable with **death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for 10 years or more**, and they fail to appear at the time and place specified in the proclamation, the Court may, after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, declare them a "Proclaimed Offender."  
* *Example:* **Kanishth** is accused of a major robbery in **Bhopal** (punishable by 10+ years). He ignores the proclamation. After 30 days, Judge **Saurabh** can formally declare **Kanishth** a Proclaimed Offender.

**5\. Status of a Proclaimed Offender in the Eyes of Law**

The status of a PO carries severe legal disabilities and consequences:

* **Offense under BNS:** Under **Section 209 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**, failing to appear in response to a proclamation is a separate cognizable and non-bailable offense punishable by up to 3 years (or 7 years for grave crimes).  
* **No Anticipatory Bail:** Generally, a PO is not entitled to anticipatory bail, as they have already shown a tendency to defy the law.  
* **Trial in Absentia (Section 356 \- New Provision):** This is a revolutionary feature of the BNSS. If a PO remains at large and cannot be caught, the Court can proceed with the trial and pronounce the judgment even in their **absence**.  
* **Attachment of Property:** Their property can be seized immediately under Section 85\.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions relating to proclamation under the **BNSS 2023** are designed to ensure that no one is "above the law" by simply running away. By expanding the definition of Proclaimed Offenders to include any serious crime, the Sanhita provides officers like **Raghavendra** in **Lucknow** or **Laukendra** in **Indore** with the necessary leverage to bring criminals to justice. The introduction of trial in absentia under Section 356 ensures that victims like **Satyam** do not have to wait decades for a verdict just because the accused is hiding. For offenders like **Kanishth**, the law sends a clear message: absconding will not halt the wheels of justice; it will only accelerate the loss of their property and their right to a personal defense in court.

---

## Q8. When may a Court order attachment of the property of a person who has absconded? Explain. Or Explain the provisions related to the attachment of property of absconded person with suitable illustration. 

**Introduction**

The attachment of property is a stringent legal measure designed to act as a compelling force against an accused person who attempts to evade the process of law. While a proclamation (Section 84\) serves as a public notice, "Attachment" is a physical and legal seizure of the absconder's assets. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, these provisions are primarily contained in **Section 85** (corresponding to Section 83 of the old CrPC). The rationale behind this is simple: when an offender like **Kanishth** realizes that his property—his home, his bank accounts, or even his livestock—is being taken over by the State, the financial and social pressure often forces him to surrender. The BNSS 2023 ensures that this power is exercised with judicial oversight to protect "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), ensuring that the attachment serves the dual purpose of punishing the absconder and securing the interests of justice.

**Main Body**

**1\. When Can a Court Order Attachment? (Section 85(1))**

A court can order the attachment of property at any time after the issuance of a proclamation under Section 84\. Generally, it is the second step in the process, but the law allows for Simultaneous Attachment in exceptional cases. If the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the person:

* Is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property; or  
* Is about to remove the property from the local jurisdiction of the Court.  
  In such cases, the court can issue the attachment order along with the proclamation notice.  
* *Example:* **Raghavendra** is a judge in **Varanasi**. He issues a proclamation for **Saurabh**, who is absconding. However, **Laukendra**, the Investigating Officer, informs the court that **Saurabh** is trying to sell his ancestral house in **Varanasi** to flee to another country. **Raghavendra** can immediately order the attachment of that house to prevent its sale.

**2\. Manner of Attachment (Section 85(3) & (4))**

The method of attachment depends on the nature of the property belonging to the absconder:

* **Movable Property:** For items like cars, jewelry, or debts, attachment is made by:  
  * Actual seizure (taking it into custody).  
  * Appointment of a receiver (a person to manage the asset).  
  * An order prohibiting the delivery of the property to the absconder.  
  * *Example:* **Krishna** is an absconder in **Lucknow**. The court orders the attachment of his luxury car. Officer **Sachkeerat** physically seizes the car and parks it at the police station.  
* **Immovable Property:** For land or buildings, attachment is made by:  
  * Taking possession.  
  * Appointment of a receiver.  
  * Prohibiting the payment of rent or delivery of the property to the absconder.  
  * In the case of land paying revenue to the State, the attachment is made through the **Collector** of the district.  
  * *Example:* **Prateek** owns a farm in **Indore**. If he absconds, the court in **Indore** will work with the District Collector to take over the farm and prevent **Prateek** from receiving any income from the crops.

**3\. Jurisdiction and Special Cases**

An order of attachment is valid for property within the district where it is issued. If the property is outside the district, it must be endorsed by the District Magistrate of that particular district. Furthermore, if the property consists of livestock or perishable goods (like vegetables or milk), the court may order an immediate sale, and the proceeds will be kept by the court.

* *Example:* **Satyam** absconds from **Patna**, but he owns a dairy farm in **Jaipur**. The court in **Patna** must get the order endorsed by the DM of **Jaipur** to seize the cattle. Since cows require daily care and are "livestock," the court may order their sale to prevent them from starving or losing value.

**4\. Claims and Restoration (Section 86 & 87\)**

If a third party (someone other than the absconder) claims the property belongs to them, they must file an objection within six months. If the absconder, like Kanishth, appears within two years and proves to the court that he did not intentionally abscond, the court may restore the property or the sale proceeds to him after deducting costs.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the attachment of property under the **BNSS 2023** is a powerful deterrent against the defiance of legal processes. By empowering judges like **Raghavendra** to seize both movable and immovable assets, the law ensures that absconders like **Saurabh** or **Krishna** cannot enjoy the fruits of their property while hiding from justice. The inclusion of safeguards for third-party claims and the provision for restoration ensure that the law remains "just, fair, and reasonable." This process remains a critical pillar of "Nagarik Suraksha," ensuring that in every city from **Patna** to **Amritsar**, the arm of the law is long enough to reach not just the person, but also the assets they value most.

## Q9. (a) What is meant by the First Information Report. ~~(b) How the F.I.R. is recorded in (i) Cognizable case and (ii) Non-cognizable case. Discuss the laws relating to information in cognizable cases under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023\. What new provisions have been inserted in this Sanhita and what is its evidentiary value? Discuss.~~ (c) Explain the value of F.I.R. and the effect of delay in lodging. (2024).

**Introduction**

The First Information Report, commonly known as the FIR, is the most crucial document in the Indian criminal justice system as it serves as the foundation upon which the entire superstructure of an investigation and trial is built. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the provisions for recording this information are contained in **Section 173** (which corresponds to Section 154 of the old CrPC). Although the term "First Information Report" is not explicitly defined in the Sanhita, it refers to the information relating to the commission of a cognizable offense given to the officer in charge of a police station first in point of time. The rationale behind the FIR is to set the criminal law in motion and to obtain an early record of the alleged criminal activity before there is time for the facts to be forgotten or embellished. It is the "trigger" that authorizes the police to exercise their powers of arrest and investigation, ensuring that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is initiated the moment a serious crime is reported.

**Main Body**

**1\. Meaning and Recording of FIR (Section 173\)**

An FIR is essentially a notice to the State that a cognizable crime has occurred. Under Section 173(1), any person can give information about a cognizable offense to the police. This information can be provided in two primary ways:

* **Orally:** If given orally to an officer like **Raghavendra** in **Lucknow**, it must be reduced to writing by him or under his direction and read over to the informant. Every such report must be signed by the person giving it.  
* **Electronic Communication (e-FIR):** A modern feature of the BNSS is that information can be sent electronically. However, to be treated as a valid FIR, it must be taken on record and signed by the informant within **three days**.  
* **Zero FIR:** Irrespective of where the crime took place, an officer must record the information. For example, if **Prateek** is robbed in **Patna** but reports it to Officer **Saurabh** in **Indore**, **Saurabh** must register a "Zero FIR" and transfer it to the relevant station in **Patna**.

**2\. The Value of an FIR**

The legal value of an FIR is multifaceted, although it is well-settled that an FIR is **not a substantive piece of evidence**. This means a court cannot convict someone solely based on what is written in the FIR. Its value lies in:

* **Corroboration:** Under the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA), 2023, the FIR can be used to support the testimony of the informant, like **Krishna**, when he stands as a witness in court.  
* **Contradiction:** If **Krishna** changes his story during the trial in **Lucknow**, the defense lawyer for **Kanishth** can use the original FIR to show inconsistencies and challenge **Krishna’s** credibility.  
* **Dying Declaration:** If the informant dies after lodging the FIR due to injuries sustained in the crime, the FIR can be treated as a "Dying Declaration," which is a substantive piece of evidence.  
* **Res Gestae:** It shows the conduct of the informant immediately after the incident.

**3\. Effect of Delay in Lodging FIR**

The law requires that an FIR should be lodged at the **earliest possible opportunity**. The rationale is that a prompt FIR reduces the chances of "afterthought," "concoction," or "fabrication" of a story.

* **Suspicion and Scrutiny:** An unexplained or unreasonable delay in filing an FIR gives rise to suspicion. If **Satyam** is assaulted in **Varanasi** on Monday but waits until Friday to file an FIR without a good reason, the court will look at his story with extreme caution, fearing that he used the time to falsely implicate innocent people like **Laukendra**.  
* **Acceptable Explanations:** Delay is not always fatal to the prosecution. If the delay is reasonably explained—such as the informant being unconscious, a medical emergency, or the extreme trauma and social stigma involved in rape cases—the court will accept it.  
* *Example:* **Sachkeerat** is seriously injured in a road accident in **Amritsar**. His family spends the first 48 hours in the hospital trying to save his life. The delay in filing the FIR against the driver is well-explained and will not hurt the case's credibility in the eyes of the Magistrate.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the First Information Report under the **BNSS 2023** remains the bedrock of criminal proceedings. While it is not a substantive piece of evidence like a witness's testimony in court, its value as a tool for corroboration and contradiction is indispensable. The introduction of e-FIR and Zero FIR ensures that technology serves the cause of justice, making it easier for citizens like **Prateek** to report crimes. However, the requirement of promptness highlights the importance of truth; an early FIR by **Krishna** in **Lucknow** provides a snapshot of the truth before it is clouded by legal advice or malice. Ultimately, the FIR ensures that the investigation starts on a solid foundation, protecting the innocent while ensuring that the guilty, like **Kanishth**, are brought to justice through a "procedure established by law."

## Q10. Discuss the power of police officer to Investigate a cognizable offence and procedure of investigation. 

**Introduction**

Investigation is the foundational phase of the criminal justice system where the police gather evidence to identify and apprehend an offender. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, an investigation is essentially a search for the truth to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to bring an accused person to trial. The primary object of an investigation is the "collection of evidence" by a police officer or an authorized person. Unlike an inquiry, which is a judicial process conducted by a Magistrate, an investigation is purely an executive and administrative function. For cognizable offenses—which are serious crimes like murder, rape, or kidnapping—the law grants the police wide powers to act swiftly to protect society. The BNSS 2023 has modernized this process by integrating forensic science and digital technology, ensuring that the procedure is not only effective but also transparent and accountable to the citizens of India.

**Main Body**

**1\. Power to Investigate Cognizable Offences (Section 175\)**

The power of a police officer to investigate a cognizable case is found in Section 175 of the BNSS (corresponding to Section 156 of the old CrPC). This section empowers any officer in charge of a police station to investigate such cases without the prior order of a Magistrate. This is a crucial "unrestricted" power intended to prevent any delay in securing justice.

* **Example:** In **Bhopal**, **Prateek** reports a case of housebreaking and theft. Officer **Saurabh**, as the station in-charge, does not need to wait for a court order. He can immediately start the investigation to catch the suspect, **Kanishth**, and recover the stolen goods.

**2\. Preliminary Enquiry vs. Direct Investigation (Section 173(3))**

A significant reform in the BNSS 2023 is the provision for a Preliminary Enquiry. For offenses punishable with three to seven years of imprisonment, the police officer, with the prior permission of an officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent (like Sachkeerat), may conduct a 14-day enquiry to see if a prima facie case exists before registering a regular FIR. However, for more serious offenses (above seven years), the police must proceed with the investigation immediately.

**3\. Procedure for Investigation (Section 176\)**

The standard procedure involves several steps:

* **Report to Magistrate:** The officer must send a report to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offense.  
* **Proceeding to the Spot:** The investigating officer must go to the scene of the crime to inspect and collect evidence.  
* **Forensic Mandatory Requirement:** Under BNSS, if the crime is punishable by seven years or more, the officer **must** involve a forensic expert like **Laukendra** to collect evidence. This process must also be videographed on a mobile phone to ensure it is not tampered with.  
* **Example:** After **Kanishth** is accused of a serious robbery in **Indore**, Officer **Raghavendra** calls **Laukendra**, a forensic specialist. **Laukendra** gathers fingerprints and blood samples while the entire process is recorded on a digital device to preserve the integrity of the scene.

**4\. Examination of Witnesses (Section 180\)**

The police officer has the power to summon any person who appears to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case. These statements can now be recorded using audio-video electronic means.

* **Example:** During the investigation in **Lucknow**, Officer **Saurabh** calls **Krishna**, who was a witness to the crime. **Saurabh** records **Krishna’s** statement using a video recorder to maintain the accuracy of the testimony and prevent future retractions.

**5\. Search and Seizure (Section 185\)**

If the officer has reason to believe that things necessary for investigation are in a certain place, they can conduct a search. Again, the BNSS mandates that the search and seizure be videographed (under Section 105\) to ensure transparency and prevent the "planting" of evidence.

**6\. Formation of Opinion and Police Report (Section 193\)**

Once the evidence is collected, the officer forms an opinion. If there is enough evidence, a "Charge Sheet" is filed; otherwise, a "Final Report" (Closure Report) is submitted to the Magistrate. The police must inform the informant, like Prateek, of the progress within 90 days, ensuring the victim is central to the process.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the power and procedure of investigation under the **BNSS 2023** are designed to ensure a faster and more credible criminal justice system. By granting officers like **Saurabh** and **Raghavendra** the power to investigate cognizable offenses without delay under Section 175, the law prioritizes "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection). The inclusion of mandatory forensics through experts like **Laukendra** and the use of videography ensures that the collection of evidence is immune to manipulation. Whether it is a case in **Varanasi** involving **Satyam** or in **Patna** involving **Sachkeerat**, the new Sanhita ensures that the investigation is a transparent search for justice, respecting both the rights of the victim and the dignity of the accused.

## Q11. Point out those processes to procure personal attendance of a person in the Court.

**Introduction**

The primary objective of the criminal justice system is to ensure that trials and inquiries proceed without unnecessary delay, which is only possible when all relevant parties—the accused and the witnesses—are present before the court. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides a comprehensive set of legal "processes" to compel the personal attendance of an individual. These processes are contained in **Chapter VI** and are designed as an escalating series of measures. The law begins with the least coercive method (Summons) and moves toward more forceful actions (Warrants) if the person fails to comply. In cases of total defiance or absconding, the court can resort to public proclamations and the seizure of property. The rationale is to uphold the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) by ensuring that the law is not mocked by those who choose to ignore judicial orders. For citizens like **Prateek** and **Krishna**, these processes ensure that justice is not stalled by the absence of an essential participant in cities like **Lucknow** or **Indore**.

**Main Body**

**1\. Summons (Sections 63 to 71\)**

A summons is the first and gentlest step to procure attendance. It is a formal order from a court requiring a person to appear at a specific date and time. Under Section 63, a valid summons must be in writing, in duplicate, and signed and sealed by the presiding officer. A significant modernization in the BNSS 2023 is that summons can now be served through electronic communication (like email or encrypted apps) and can bear a digital signature.

* **How Served:** It is usually served personally by a police officer. If the person cannot be found, it can be left with an adult family member.  
* **Example:** In **Bhopal**, Judge **Saurabh** issues a summons to **Kanishth** to testify as a witness. Officer **Raghavendra** serves the summons to **Kanishth** personally. **Kanishth** signs the duplicate copy, acknowledging the duty to appear. If **Kanishth** were a government servant in **Patna**, the summons would be sent to his department head, **Sachkeerat**, for delivery.

**2\. Warrant of Arrest (Sections 72 to 83\)**

If a person ignores a summons or if the court has reason to believe that a summons will not be effective, it may issue a warrant of arrest. A warrant is a more coercive tool that authorizes the police to arrest the person and produce them before the court.

* **Kinds of Warrants:** It can be "Bailable" (where the officer releases the person on a bond) or "Non-Bailable."  
* **Example:** If **Laukendra** is accused of a crime in **Jaipur** and refuses to attend court despite multiple summons, Judge **Satyam** issues a non-bailable warrant. Officer **Sachkeerat** then travels to **Jaipur**, arrests **Laukendra**, and brings him before the court in **Varanasi**.

**3\. Proclamation for Absconding Persons (Section 84\)**

When a warrant cannot be executed because the person is hiding or has fled, the court may issue a "Proclamation." This is a public notice requiring the person to appear within thirty days.

* **Publicity:** It is read out in the local market and pasted on the person's door. Under **Section 84(4)**, if the offense is serious (10+ years or death), the court can formally declare the person a "Proclaimed Offender."  
* **Example:** **Krishna** absconds from **Amritsar** to avoid a warrant for a serious robbery. The court in **Amritsar** issues a proclamation. A public announcement is made in **Krishna’s** neighborhood, and a copy is pasted on his house. If he doesn't show up in 30 days, he becomes a Proclaimed Offender.

**4\. Attachment of Property (Section 85\)**

The final and most severe measure is the "Attachment" of property. The court orders the seizure of the absconder's movable or immovable assets to create financial pressure to appear.

* **Simultaneous Order:** If the court believes the person is about to sell their assets to flee, it can issue a proclamation and an attachment order at the same time.  
* **Example:** While **Krishna** is hiding, the court in **Amritsar** orders the attachment of his ancestral land and his bank accounts. Faced with the loss of his livelihood, **Krishna** is forced to surrender to the law.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the processes to procure personal attendance under the **BNSS 2023** represent a tiered approach to judicial authority. By starting with a simple summons and moving toward the seizure of assets, the law gives every individual, from **Kanishth** to **Laukendra**, an opportunity to comply voluntarily before more coercive measures are taken. The inclusion of digital summons reflects a commitment to a faster, 21st-century legal system. These provisions ensure that in every city from **Lucknow** to **Indore**, the judicial process remains uninterrupted. The power of the court to proclaim an absconder or attach their property ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" is maintained and that the arm of the law eventually reaches everyone required for the fair administration of justice.

## Q12. Discuss the procedure for the service of summons.

**Introduction**

A "Summons" is a judicial process used by a court to compel the appearance of a person, whether as an accused or as a witness. It is essentially a polite but firm command from the court. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the procedure for the service of summons is detailed in **Sections 64 to 71**. The rationale behind these provisions is to ensure that the individual is officially and undeniably informed of the legal proceedings against them, upholding the principle of *Audi Alteram Partem* (hear the other side). The BNSS 2023 has modernized this procedure by granting legal sanctity to electronic service, ensuring that in a digital age, justice is not stalled by the physical absence or evasion of a party. By providing a clear hierarchy of service methods—from personal delivery to electronic communication—the Sanhita ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is maintained through a transparent and efficient legal process.

**Main Body**

The procedure for serving a summons follows a systematic and mandatory path to ensure it reaches the intended person.

**1\. Personal Service (Section 64\)**

The primary and most preferred method is personal service. Every summons must be served by a police officer or an officer of the court.

* **The Process:** The officer must deliver or tender one of the duplicates of the summons to the person personally. The person is then required to sign a receipt on the back of the other duplicate.  
* **Modern Update:** Under Section 64(2) of the BNSS, a summons bearing the image of the court's seal can now be served by **electronic communication** (email, encrypted messaging, etc.).  
* *Example:* In **Lucknow**, Officer **Raghavendra** is tasked with serving a summons to **Prateek**. He visits **Prateek’s** house and hands him the document. **Prateek** signs the copy, and the service is complete. Alternatively, the court may send the summons to **Prateek’s** registered email.

**2\. Service on Corporate Bodies and Firms (Section 65\)**

When the person to be summoned is a company or a corporation, the summons may be served on the Director, Manager, or Secretary. In the case of a firm, it can be served on any partner.

* *Example:* A court in **Indore** issues a summons to a firm where **Krishna** is a partner. Service is considered valid if the document is delivered to **Krishna** or sent via registered post to the firm's office in **Indore**.

**3\. Service when Person cannot be found (Section 66\)**

If the person named in the summons cannot be found despite due diligence, the law allows for service on an adult member of the family (male or female) residing with him. A servant is not considered a family member for this purpose.

* *Example:* Officer **Saurabh** goes to serve a summons to **Kanishth** in **Bhopal**, but **Kanishth** is away. **Saurabh** hands the summons to **Kanishth’s** elder brother, **Satyam**, who signs the receipt.

**4\. Service by Affixture (Section 67\)**

If service cannot be effected through the above methods, the officer must affix one of the duplicates to a "conspicuous part" of the house where the person ordinarily resides (usually the front door). The court then decides if the service was sufficient.

**5\. Service on Government Servants (Section 68\)**

If the person is in active government service, the court sends the summons in duplicate to the Head of the Office where the person works. That head is then responsible for serving it and returning it with the person’s signature.

* *Example:* **Sachkeerat** is a government officer in **Amritsar**. The court sends his summons to his superior, who ensures **Sachkeerat** receives it and signs the duplicate.

**6\. Service Outside Local Jurisdiction (Section 69\)**

When a court in Patna needs to serve a summons in Jaipur, it sends the duplicate to a Magistrate in Jaipur, who then directs a local officer to serve it.

**7\. Proof of Service (Section 70\)**

If the serving officer is not present at the hearing, an affidavit stating that the summons was served, along with the signed duplicate, is admissible as evidence of service. Under BNSS, a copy of the electronic summons is also kept as proof.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the procedure for the service of summons under the **BNSS 2023** is a blend of traditional safeguards and modern efficiency. By moving from personal delivery by officers like **Raghavendra** to digital service for individuals like **Prateek**, the Sanhita ensures that no one can evade the law by simply "not being home." The clear rules for corporate bodies, family members, and government servants ensure that the legal process remains uninterrupted. These provisions collectively guarantee that every individual involved in a criminal matter in cities from **Lucknow** to **Varanasi** is given a fair notice, thereby protecting the sanctity of the trial and the rights of all citizens.

## Q13. Can summons be served on witness by post? If so, how?

**Introduction**

While the traditional method of serving a summons involves personal delivery by a police officer, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, recognizes the need for faster and more flexible communication in the modern world. Under **Section 71** (which corresponds to Section 69 of the old CrPC), the law explicitly provides for the service of summons on witnesses through the post. This provision is a "supplementary" power, meaning it can be used in addition to the standard methods of service. The rationale behind this is to ensure that witnesses, who are often neutral parties or experts (like doctors or forensic scientists), can be notified of their court dates without the unnecessary burden of multiple police visits. By allowing service by post, the BNSS 2023 streamlines the judicial process in cities like **Lucknow** or **Indore**, ensuring that the absence of a witness does not become a hurdle in the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) mission of the State.

**Main Body**

**1\. The Statutory Power: Section 71(1)**

Section 71(1) of the BNSS states that a Court issuing a summons to a witness may, in addition to and simultaneously with the issue of such summons, direct a copy of the summons to be served by Registered Post.

* **Address for Service:** The summons must be addressed to the witness at the place where they:  
  * Ordinarily reside.  
  * Carry on business.  
  * Personally work for gain.  
* **Modern Addition:** The BNSS 2023 has significantly expanded this to include **electronic communication** (email, messaging apps, etc.) alongside registered post.  
* *Example:* Judge **Raghavendra** in **Varanasi** needs to summon **Dr. Saurabh**, a medical witness residing in **Bhopal**. While a local officer in **Bhopal** might attempt personal service, the Court simultaneously sends a copy of the summons to **Dr. Saurabh’s** clinic via registered post and his official email.

**2\. When is Service Deemed Sufficient? (Section 71(2))**

The law provides two specific scenarios where the postal service is considered "duly served," even if the witness is not present in court:

* **Acknowledgment Signed:** When the court receives a postal acknowledgment (the "pink slip" or AD card) that appears to be signed by the witness.  
* **Refusal to Accept:** This is a crucial rule. If the court receives an endorsement from a postal employee stating that the **witness refused to take delivery** of the summons, the court may declare that the summons has been duly served.  
* *Example:* If **Kanishth** in **Amritsar** sees the court’s letter and tells the postman, "I will not accept this," the postman marks it as "Refused." Under Section 71, Judge **Satyam** will treat this as if **Kanishth** has been officially notified. **Kanishth** cannot later claim he didn't know about the hearing.

**3\. Simultaneous Service Strategy**

The use of the word "simultaneously" in the section means the court doesn't have to wait for personal service to fail before using the post. This "double-track" system ensures that even if a witness like Krishna in Lucknow is not home when the police officer visits, the registered letter waiting at his office or his home will serve as a valid legal notice.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the service of summons on a witness by post under **Section 71 of the BNSS 2023** is a practical and effective legal tool. By allowing registered post and electronic communication to be used alongside traditional methods, the Sanhita ensures that witnesses like **Dr. Saurabh** or **Krishna** are reached efficiently. The "Refusal rule" prevents individuals from obstructing the course of justice by simply turning away the postman. This provision upholds the efficiency of the criminal justice system in every district, from **Patna** to **Amritsar**, ensuring that trials proceed on schedule and the rights of both the victim and the accused are protected through a "just, fair, and reasonable" procedure.

## Q14. What do you understand by warrant? Explain its kinds in detail.

**Introduction**

While a summons is a mere invitation to appear in court, a "Warrant" is an authoritative command that authorizes the deprivation of a person's liberty to ensure their presence. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, a warrant of arrest is the next stage in the "process to compel appearance" when a summons is either ignored or deemed insufficient. It is a legal document issued by a competent court, directed to a police officer or another person, commanding them to arrest a specific individual and produce them before the court. The rationale behind a warrant is to uphold the majesty of the law; it ensures that an accused person like **Kanishth** cannot stall the wheels of justice by simply staying away. The BNSS 2023 preserves the sanctity of this process while providing clear rules on how a warrant must be formed, to whom it should be directed, and the different "kinds" that allow for varying degrees of flexibility regarding bail.

**Main Body**

**1\. Form and Duration of Warrant (Section 72\)**

According to Section 72 of the BNSS, every warrant of arrest issued by a Court must meet three essential legal requirements:

* **In Writing:** It cannot be a verbal order.  
* **Signed:** It must be signed by the presiding officer of the Court.  
* Sealed: It must bear the official seal of the Court.  
  Duration: Once issued, a warrant does not expire by the passage of time. It remains in force until it is either executed (the person is arrested) or cancelled by the Court that issued it.  
* *Example:* Judge **Krishna** in **Lucknow** issues a warrant for **Satyam**. Even if Officer **Raghavendra** takes six months to find **Satyam**, the warrant remains legally valid unless Judge **Krishna** withdraws it.

**2\. Kinds of Warrants**

Warrants are primarily classified into two kinds based on the "Endorsement" regarding bail:

* **Bailable Warrant (Section 73):** Under Section 73, a Court may, at its discretion, make an "endorsement" on the warrant. This endorsement states that if the person to be arrested executes a bond with sufficient sureties for their attendance in court, the officer shall release them from custody.  
  * *Example:* If **Prateek** is accused of a minor offense in **Indore**, the Court might issue a bailable warrant. When Officer **Saurabh** arrests **Prateek**, he informs him of the endorsement. If **Prateek** provides the required security, **Saurabh** must release him immediately without taking him to the station.  
* **Non-Bailable Warrant (NBW):** If the warrant does not contain such an endorsement, it is a non-bailable warrant. In this case, the arresting officer has no discretion; they must arrest the person and produce them before the court. This is usually issued for serious offenses or when the person has a history of absconding.

**3\. To Whom Directed (Section 74\)**

A warrant is ordinarily directed to one or more police officers. However, if its immediate execution is necessary and no police officer is available, the Court may direct it to any other person.

* *Example:* In a remote area near **Varanasi**, where no police are immediately present, a Magistrate might direct a warrant to **Laukendra**, a respectable local citizen, to arrest an escaped convict.

**4\. Special Warrants by CJM or JMFC (Section 75\)**

Under Section 75, a Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Magistrate of the First Class may direct a warrant to any person within their local jurisdiction for the arrest of:

* An escaped convict.  
* A proclaimed offender.  
* A person accused of a non-bailable offense who is evading arrest.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, a warrant under the **BNSS 2023** is a powerful instrument of judicial authority. By defining the strict form in Section 72 and the various kinds—such as the bailable warrant under Section 73—the law ensures that the power to arrest is used proportionately. For officers like **Sachkeerat** or **Raghavendra**, the warrant provides the legal shield necessary to perform their duty of bringing suspects like **Satyam** to court. Whether it is a bailable warrant allowing for immediate release or a non-bailable one for grave crimes, these "processes" ensure that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is maintained and that no individual can avoid the judicial gaze in cities from **Patna** to **Amritsar**.

## Q15. Explain the requirement of a valid warrant.

**Introduction**

A "Warrant of Arrest" is a solemn judicial order that commands the apprehension of an individual. Unlike a summons, which is an invitation to appear, a warrant is an instrument of compulsion that authorizes the interference with a person's fundamental right to liberty. For this reason, the law demands that such a document must be "in order" and strictly comply with specific statutory requirements. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, these requirements are primarily governed by **Section 72** (corresponding to Section 70 of the old CrPC). The rationale behind these strict formalities is to prevent the misuse of power and to ensure that the person being arrested is precisely identified and informed of the charges against them. An "invalid warrant" makes the resulting arrest illegal, potentially leading to the discharge of the accused and legal action against the executing officer.

**Main Body**

For a warrant of arrest to be legally valid and binding in cities like **Lucknow** or **Indore**, it must satisfy the following essential requirements:

**1\. Form and Formalities (Section 72\)**

* **In Writing:** A warrant must be a written document. A Magistrate, such as **Krishna**, cannot orally order a police officer to go and arrest someone under a "warrant"; it must be reduced to a formal paper.  
* **Signed by the Presiding Officer:** It must be personally signed by the Judge or Magistrate who issues it. A rubber stamp signature or a signature by a court clerk is not sufficient and renders the warrant void.  
* **Seal of the Court:** The warrant must bear the official seal of the issuing Court. The seal acts as the "authority of the State," proving that the document is a genuine product of the judiciary.  
  * *Example:* If Judge **Raghavendra** in **Varanasi** issues a warrant for **Satyam** but forgets to put the court's seal on it, Officer **Saurabh** cannot legally execute it. If he does, **Satyam** can challenge the arrest as unconstitutional.

**2\. Particulars of the Accused**

A valid warrant must describe the person to be arrested with reasonable certainty. It should include:

* The **Full Name** of the accused.  
* **Identification Details:** To avoid cases of mistaken identity, the warrant should mention the father's name, age, and occupation.  
* **Address:** The place of residence or work must be clearly stated.  
  * *Example:* A warrant issued in **Bhopal** for "Prateek" without a surname or father's name is dangerously vague. If Officer **Sachkeerat** arrests the wrong **Prateek**, the lack of specific details in the warrant would be the primary legal flaw.

**3\. Statement of the Offence**

The warrant must state the specific "special matter" or the offence for which the person is to be arrested. It should mention the section of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) or other laws alleged to have been violated. This fulfills the constitutional requirement of informing the person of the grounds of their arrest.

**4\. Direction to the Executing Officer**

A warrant must be "directed" to a specific person or persons who are to execute it. Usually, it is directed to a police officer. However, in urgent cases where no police are available, a Magistrate can direct it to a private individual like Laukendra. A warrant that is not directed to anyone is essentially an "open" or "general" warrant, which is illegal in Indian law.

**5\. Bailable Endorsement (Section 73\)**

If the court intends to allow the person to be released on bail immediately after arrest, the warrant must contain a "Bailable Endorsement." This must specify the number of sureties, the amount of the bond, and the time at which the person is to attend the court. Without this specific endorsement, the warrant is treated as "Non-Bailable."

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the requirements of a valid warrant under the **BNSS 2023** serve as a vital safeguard for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection). By mandating that the document be in writing, signed, and sealed, the law ensures that the gravity of an arrest is reflected in its documentation. Clear identification of the accused and the offence ensures that justice is targeted and transparent. For judicial officers like **Krishna** and police officers like **Saurabh**, a "valid warrant" is the only legal shield that permits the deprivation of liberty. In every jurisdiction from **Patna** to **Amritsar**, strict adherence to these formalities under Section 72 ensures that the rule of law prevails over arbitrary executive action.

## Q16. Differentiate between summon and warrant.

**Introduction**

In the criminal justice system, the courts use specific "processes" to ensure that the individuals necessary for a trial—whether they are the accused or witnesses—are present in the courtroom. These processes follow a hierarchy of compulsion. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, categorizes these into two primary instruments: the **Summons** (Sections 63–71) and the **Warrant of Arrest** (Sections 72–83). While both aim to secure personal attendance, they differ fundamentally in their nature, the level of force involved, and the persons to whom they are directed. The rationale for this distinction is the protection of "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection); the law prefers the least intrusive method first. A summons is a "call to appear," while a warrant is an "order to arrest." Under the new Sanhita, the distinction has been further modernized by the inclusion of electronic service for summons, while warrants remain a strictly physical instrument of judicial authority.

---

**Main Body**

The differences between a Summons and a Warrant under the **BNSS 2023** can be understood through the following table:

| Feature | Summons (Sec 63–71) | Warrant of Arrest (Sec 72–83) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Basic Nature** | A formal document commanding a person to appear before the court. | A judicial order commanding a police officer to arrest and produce a person. |
| **Object** | Directed to the person whose attendance is required (Accused or Witness). | Directed to a police officer (or another person) for execution. |
| **Degree of Force** | No force is involved; it is an expectation of voluntary compliance. | Coercive in nature; it authorizes the deprivation of liberty. |
| **Electronic Service** | **Explicitly allowed** under Section 64 via encrypted email or messaging. | No "electronic warrant"; must be a physical document, though it can be forwarded electronically. |
| **Duration** | Valid only for the specific date and time mentioned in the document. | Remains in force until it is **executed** or **cancelled** by the issuing court. |
| **Number of Copies** | Always issued in **duplicate**. | Always issued as a **single** document. |

**Practical Illustration of the Difference**

Imagine a case in **Lucknow** where Judge **Krishna** is presiding.

* **Summons:** If **Prateek** is needed as a witness, **Krishna** issues a summons. Officer **Saurabh** delivers it to **Prateek**. **Prateek** simply signs the copy and is expected to show up on the trial date. If he doesn't, it is a "disobedience of a lawful order."  
* **Warrant:** If **Kanishth** is an accused who has already ignored three summons, **Krishna** will issue a warrant. This time, **Saurabh** will go to **Kanishth’s** house, take him into physical custody, and bring him directly to the court in **Lucknow**. **Kanishth** has no choice in the matter.

**Authority and Discretion**

Under Section 227 of the BNSS, a Magistrate like Raghavendra in Varanasi has the discretion to choose the process. In "Summons-cases" (minor offenses), he must issue a summons first. In "Warrant-cases" (serious crimes), he may issue a warrant or a summons. However, under Section 90, if the court believes that an accused like Satyam will abscond or ignore a summons, it can issue a "Warrant in lieu of summons," moving directly to the more forceful option to ensure "Nagarik Suraksha."

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the distinction between a summons and a warrant is a cornerstone of a fair "procedure established by law." While a summons respects the dignity and voluntary compliance of citizens like **Prateek**, a warrant serves as a necessary tool for the State to catch those who, like **Kanishth**, attempt to evade justice. The **BNSS 2023** maintains this balance by allowing modern technology to speed up the service of summons while keeping the physical warrants as a serious last resort. Whether it is a polite notice in **Bhopal** or a physical arrest in **Amritsar**, these processes ensure that the court is never left without the people it needs to deliver justice.

---

## Q17. What is the form of warrant?

**Introduction**

A "Warrant of Arrest" is a formal judicial document that carries the highest level of legal compulsion. While a summons is merely an order to appear, a warrant is an instrument of authority that directs a law enforcement officer to physically seize a person and produce them before the Court. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the "Form" of a warrant is not merely a matter of administrative convenience but a strict legal requirement. A warrant that fails to follow the prescribed form is considered "illegal" and any arrest made under it can be challenged in a court of law. The rationale behind such rigid formalities is to protect "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) by ensuring that the State's power to deprive a person of their liberty is exercised with total transparency and precision. By mandating specific details like the signature of the judge and the court's seal, the Sanhita ensures that the document is authentic and that the accused, like **Kanishth**, is fully aware of why they are being taken into custody.

---

**Main Body**

According to **Section 72** of the BNSS 2023 and the **Second Schedule (Form No. 2\)**, the "Form" of a valid warrant of arrest must satisfy the following essential elements:

**1\. General Requirements (Section 72\)**

* **In Writing:** A warrant must be a written document. A verbal order from a Magistrate, such as **Krishna**, to a police officer to "go and arrest that person" does not constitute a valid warrant.  
* **Signed by the Presiding Officer:** It must be signed by the Judge or Magistrate personally. A rubber stamp or a digital signature (unless specifically authorized for that class of document) is generally insufficient; the physical signature represents the judge’s application of mind.  
* **Seal of the Court:** The document must bear the official seal of the issuing Court. This is the ultimate proof of the document’s judicial origin.  
  * *Example:* If Judge **Raghavendra** in **Lucknow** issues a warrant for **Prateek** but forgets to put the court's seal on it, the warrant is technically incomplete and invalid.

**2\. Specific Contents (Form No. 2, Second Schedule)**

The actual "body" of the warrant must contain specific particulars to avoid any case of mistaken identity:

* **Name and Description of the Accused:** It must state the name, father's name, age, and residence of the person to be arrested. Vague descriptions like "Prateek of Lucknow" are illegal.  
* **The Specific Offence:** It must clearly state the offence under the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)** or other laws that the person is accused of. This is a constitutional right under Article 22\.  
* **Direction to the Executing Officer:** It must be addressed to a specific person, usually the "Officer in Charge" of a police station.  
  * *Example:* A warrant in **Bhopal** would be directed to "The Officer-in-Charge, Police Station Arera Hills."

**3\. The Bailable Endorsement (Section 73\)**

If the court chooses to make the warrant "Bailable," it must contain a specific endorsement on the form itself. This includes:

* The number of sureties.  
* The amount for which they and the person to be arrested are to be bound.  
* The time at which the person is to attend the court.  
  * *Example:* If **Saurabh** is arrested in **Indore** on a bailable warrant, the officer sees the endorsement, takes the security, and releases him immediately.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the "Form" of a warrant under the **BNSS 2023** is the definitive boundary between legal authority and arbitrary detention. By requiring the document to be in writing, signed, and sealed as per Section 72, the law ensures that the gravity of an arrest is respected. The detailed particulars required by Form No. 2 of the Second Schedule ensure that officers like **Raghavendra** or **Saurabh** target the correct individual, thereby preventing the harassment of innocent citizens. Whether it is a non-bailable warrant for a grave crime or a bailable one for a minor offence, the strictness of the "form" remains a primary safeguard for the liberty of every person in cities across India, from **Patna** to **Amritsar**.

---

## Q18. Can a warrant be forwarded for execution outside Jurisdiction?

**Introduction**

A "Warrant of Arrest" is typically executed within the local jurisdiction of the Court that issued it. However, the law recognizes that criminals often cross district or state boundaries to evade justice. To ensure that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is not hindered by administrative borders, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides a specific legal mechanism for the execution of warrants outside jurisdiction. Under **Sections 80 and 81** (corresponding to Sections 78 and 79 of the old CrPC), a warrant can be "forwarded" or "directed" to authorities in another area. This ensures that the "long arm of the law" can reach an accused person like **Kanishth** even if he flees from **Lucknow** to **Mumbai**. The Sanhita balances this power with procedural safeguards, requiring the involvement of local authorities in the destination jurisdiction to maintain legal transparency and accountability.

---

**Main Body**

There are two primary ways a warrant is executed outside the issuing Court’s jurisdiction under the BNSS 2023:

**1\. Forwarding the Warrant (Section 80\)**

Instead of sending its own police officers, a Court may choose to "forward" the warrant to the authorities in the place where the accused is believed to be.

* **To Whom:** The warrant is sent by post or otherwise to an **Executive Magistrate**, **District Superintendent of Police (DSP)**, or **Commissioner of Police** within whose jurisdiction it is to be executed.  
* **Procedure:** The receiving officer endorses their name on the warrant and causes it to be executed by their local police force.  
* **Bail Documents:** A modern requirement under Section 80(2) is that the issuing Court must also forward "substance of information" and documents (like the FIR or evidence) to help the local Magistrate decide whether the arrested person should be granted bail.  
  * *Example:* If a Court in **Varanasi** issues a warrant for **Prateek**, who is currently in **Delhi**, it forwards the warrant to the Commissioner of Police in **Delhi**. The Delhi police then arrest **Prateek** and handle the initial production.

**2\. Warrant Directed to a Police Officer for Execution (Section 81\)**

If a Court directs its own police officer to go and arrest someone outside its jurisdiction, that officer must follow a specific procedure:

* **Endorsement Requirement:** The officer must ordinarily take the warrant to an Executive Magistrate or a police officer (not below the rank of Station House Officer) in the local area where the arrest is to be made.  
* **Local Assistance:** Once the local official "endorses" (signs) the warrant, it gives the visiting officer the authority to make the arrest. The local police are also duty-bound to assist if requested.  
* **The "Urgency" Exception (Section 81(3)):** If there is reason to believe that the time taken to get an endorsement will allow the offender to escape, the officer may execute the warrant **without endorsement**.  
  * *Example:* Officer **Raghavendra** from **Lucknow** tracks **Satyam** to a hotel in **Indore**. If **Raghavendra** thinks **Satyam** is about to board a flight, he can arrest him immediately under the urgency clause of Section 81, without waiting for the Indore police's signature.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the **BNSS 2023** ensures that geographical boundaries do not provide sanctuary to offenders. By providing the dual methods of "forwarding" under Section 80 and "endorsement" under Section 81, the law facilitates seamless cooperation between different police forces in India. This inter-jurisdictional reach is vital for maintaining "Nagarik Suraksha" in a mobile society. While the law allows for swift action in emergencies, the general requirement for local endorsement or the forwarding of bail-related documents ensures that the rights of the person being arrested—like **Prateek** or **Satyam**—are protected under the oversight of local judicial and executive authorities, regardless of where they are caught.

---

## Q19. What is the procedure when a person against whom a warrant is issued, is arrested?

**Introduction**

The execution of a warrant of arrest is not merely about catching the suspect; it is about ensuring that the person is brought into the judicial fold through a specific legal channel. When a warrant is executed, especially outside the local jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the law must balance the efficiency of the police with the fundamental rights of the arrested person. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the "Procedure on arrest of person against whom warrant issued" is meticulously detailed in **Section 82** (corresponding to Section 80 of the old CrPC). This procedure ensures that no person is held in "legal limbo" and that they are produced before a judicial or executive authority as soon as possible. The rationale is to prevent unauthorized detention and to provide the arrested person with an immediate opportunity to seek bail if the offence permits.

---

**Main Body**

According to **Section 82** of the BNSS, when a warrant of arrest is executed, the following steps must be followed:

**1\. Production before the Nearest Magistrate (Section 82(1))**

When a person is arrested on a warrant, they must be taken before the Court which issued the warrant. However, if the arrest happens outside the district, the person must be taken before:

* An **Executive Magistrate**, or  
* The **District Superintendent of Police (DSP)**, or  
* The **Commissioner of Police** within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the arrest was made.

**2\. The "30 Kilometers" Exception**

There is a practical exception to the rule above. The arrested person does not need to be taken before the local Magistrate or DSP if:

* The Court that issued the warrant is within **thirty kilometers** of the place of arrest.  
* The issuing Court is **nearer** than the local Executive Magistrate or DSP.  
* *Example:* If **Kanishth** is arrested in a suburb of **Lucknow** that technically falls in a different district, but the issuing Court in **Lucknow** is only 15 km away, Officer **Raghavendra** will take him directly to the **Lucknow** Court instead of looking for a local Magistrate.

**3\. Handling Bailable Warrants (Section 82(1) Proviso)**

If the warrant is bailable (i.e., it contains an endorsement under Section 73\) and the person is ready and willing to give the required security, the local Magistrate or DSP must take the security and release the person. They then forward the bond to the Court that issued the warrant.

**4\. Duty to Inform (Section 82(2) \- New Provision)**

A modern safeguard introduced in the BNSS 2023 is the mandatory duty to share information. The arresting officer must "forthwith" (immediately) give information regarding the arrest and the location of the arrestee to:

* The **Designated Police Officer** in the district of arrest.  
* The police officer of the **district where the arrested person normally resides**.  
* *Example:* If **Saurabh**, who lives in **Indore**, is arrested in **Patna** on a warrant, Officer **Sachkeerat** must notify the designated officer in **Patna** and the police station in **Indore** so that **Saurabh’s** family can be informed.

**5\. Procedure by the Magistrate (Section 83\)**

Under Section 83, if the person is not released on bail, the local Magistrate will direct their removal in custody to the issuing Court. If the offence is bailable or if the High Court/Sessions Judge of the local area has given directions, the Magistrate may grant bail locally.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the procedure following an arrest on a warrant under the **BNSS 2023** is designed to ensure that the "chain of custody" is legally sound and transparent. By mandating production before the nearest authority under Section 82, the law upholds the 24-hour rule and prevents the hazards of unauthorized long-distance travel. The new requirement for inter-district communication ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) includes the right of an individual’s family to know their whereabouts. Whether the arrest is made in **Lucknow** or **Amritsar**, these procedures guarantee that suspects like **Kanishth** or **Saurabh** are handled with judicial oversight, ensuring that the promise of a fair trial begins at the very moment the handcuffs are applied.

## Q20. When can a Criminal Court issue a search warrant? Or When can a court issue a warrant to compel a person for production of a document which is relevant as evidence in a criminal matter? Under which provision of B.N.S.S., the police can conduct a search without any search warrant from court. Illustrate.

**Introduction**

A "Search Warrant" is a specialized judicial order that authorizes a police officer to enter a private premises to search for specific documents, persons, or things. In the Indian legal system, the sanctity of a person's home and privacy is protected by the Constitution, but this protection is not absolute. When the "interests of justice" outweigh the right to privacy, the Court intervenes by issuing a search warrant. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the power to issue such a warrant is primarily governed by **Section 96** (corresponding to Section 93 of the old CrPC). The rationale is to prevent the suppression of evidence; if a person like **Kanishth** refuses to hand over a vital document, the Court must have the power to "go and get it." Furthermore, the Sanhita recognizes that in urgent situations, waiting for a court warrant might lead to the destruction of evidence, thus granting the police limited powers to search without a warrant under Section 185\.

**Main Body**

**1\. When can a Criminal Court issue a Search Warrant? (Section 96\)**

A Court may issue a search warrant under three specific circumstances:

* **Failure to Produce (Section 96(1)(a)):** Where a Court has reason to believe that a person to whom a summons (under Section 94\) or a requisition (under Section 95\) has been addressed will not or would not produce the document or thing required.  
* **Possession Unknown (Section 96(1)(b)):** Where the document or thing is not known to the Court to be in the possession of any specific person.  
* **General Search/Inspection (Section 96(1)(c)):** Where the Court considers that the purposes of any inquiry, trial, or other proceeding will be served by a general search or inspection of a place.  
  * *Example:* Judge **Krishna** in **Lucknow** issues a summons to **Prateek** to produce a forged sale deed. **Prateek** ignores the summons. Judge **Krishna**, believing **Prateek** is hiding the deed, issues a search warrant to Officer **Raghavendra** to search **Prateek’s** office.

**2\. Compelling Production of Documents (Section 94\)**

Under Section 94, whenever a Court or an Officer in charge of a police station considers that the production of any document or thing is "necessary or desirable" for any investigation or trial, they may issue a summons (if a Court) or a written order (if a police officer) to the person in whose possession the item is believed to be, requiring them to attend and produce it.

**3\. Police Search Without a Warrant (Section 185\)**

Under the BNSS 2023, a police officer does not always need a warrant from a Court to conduct a search. Under Section 185 (old Section 165), an officer in charge of a police station or an investigating officer may conduct a search if:

* They have reasonable grounds to believe that something necessary for the investigation of an offence may be found in any place within the limits of the station.  
* Delay in obtaining a warrant would lead to the disappearance or destruction of evidence.  
* **The Safeguard:** The officer must record the "grounds of his belief" in writing before the search.  
* **New Mandatory Requirement:** Under Section 185(2) and Section 105 of the BNSS, the entire process of search and seizure **must be recorded through audio-video electronic means** (preferably by a mobile phone) and sent to the Magistrate within 48 hours.  
  * *Illustration:* In **Indore**, Officer **Saurabh** receives a tip that **Satyam** has hidden a blood-stained weapon in his backyard. Believing **Satyam** will bury it if he waits for a warrant from Judge **Raghavendra**, **Saurabh** records his reasons in the case diary and conducts the search immediately, filming the discovery of the weapon on his smartphone.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions of the **BNSS 2023** regarding search warrants and police searches reflect a balance between effective investigation and the prevention of police high-handedness. By specifying the three conditions for a warrant under Section 96, the law ensures that judicial authority is not used lightly. The power of the police to search without a warrant under Section 185, though broad, is now tempered by the mandatory requirement of audio-video recording under the new Sanhita. Whether it is Judge **Krishna** issuing a warrant in **Lucknow** or Officer **Saurabh** acting in an emergency in **Indore**, these "procedures established by law" ensure that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is upheld by securing evidence while maintaining transparency in the eyes of the law.

## Q21. What is the procedure of searching for a place suspected to contain stolen property?

**Introduction**

The protection of property and the recovery of stolen goods are essential duties of the State to maintain public order and deter crime. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the legal mechanism for searching a specific premises suspected of harboring illegal items is governed by **Section 97** (which corresponds to Section 94 of the old CrPC). A search of this nature is a "directed search," meaning it is not a general hunt but a targeted operation based on specific intelligence. The rationale behind this provision is to disrupt the "supply chain" of criminal activity—such as the storage of stolen jewelry, the production of counterfeit currency, or the hiding of forged documents. By allowing a Magistrate to authorize a search before a regular trial begins, the Sanhita ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is upheld through the swift recovery of property and the apprehension of those who profit from crime.

---

**Main Body**

The procedure for searching a place suspected to contain stolen property involves several strictly regulated steps:

**1\. Authority to Issue the Warrant (Section 97(1))**

A search warrant under this section cannot be issued by just any authority. Only the following Magistrates are empowered to do so:

* **District Magistrate (DM)**  
* **Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM)**  
* **Magistrate of the First Class (JMIC)**  
  The Magistrate must receive "information" and conduct such "inquiry" as they think necessary to form a "reason to believe" that a place is being used for the deposit, sale, or production of stolen property or objectionable articles.

**2\. Powers Conferred by the Warrant**

Once the warrant is issued, it is directed to a police officer above the rank of a constable. This officer is authorized to:

* **Enter:** Gain entry into the suspected house or building, using force if necessary (free ingress).  
* **Search:** Conduct a thorough search in the manner specifically described in the warrant.  
* **Seize:** Take possession of any property reasonably suspected to be stolen or any "objectionable article" found on the premises.  
* **Arrest:** Take into custody and produce before a Magistrate every person found in the place who appears to have been "privy" (involved or having knowledge) to the storage or sale of such property.  
  * *Example:* Judge **Krishna** in **Lucknow** receives a tip that a warehouse in **Alambagh** is being used to store stolen car parts. After a brief enquiry, he issues a warrant to Inspector **Saurabh**. **Saurabh** enters the warehouse, seizes the parts, and arrests the manager, **Kanishth**, who was overseeing the facility.

**3\. List of "Objectionable Articles" (Section 97(2))**

This section applies not only to stolen property but also to a specific list of illegal items, including:

* Counterfeit coins or currency notes.  
* Forged documents and false seals.  
* Obscene objects (as referred to in Section 294 of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita**).  
* Instruments or materials used for the production of these articles.

**4\. Mandatory Videography (New Requirement)**

A significant update in the BNSS 2023 is found in Section 105\. It mandates that the entire process of search and seizure—including the finding of the property and the signatures of witnesses—shall be recorded through audio-video electronic means, preferably by a mobile phone.

**Illustration:** When Officer Saurabh searches the warehouse in Lucknow, he must record the entire process on his smartphone. This video evidence is then forwarded to Magistrate Krishna to ensure that the recovery of the stolen car parts was genuine and transparent.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the procedure for searching for stolen property under **Section 97 of the BNSS 2023** provides the police with a necessary "surgical" power to recover assets and dismantle criminal dens. By requiring judicial oversight from a Magistrate of the First Class or above, the law prevents the arbitrary invasion of privacy. The modern requirement of audio-video recording under Section 105 acts as a powerful safeguard for citizens like **Prateek**, ensuring that the police, represented by officers like **Saurabh**, act with honesty and accountability. Whether it is recovering stolen gold in **Indore** or counterfeit notes in **Amritsar**, this structured procedure ensures that justice is served and that the rights of property owners are protected through a transparent legal framework.

## Q22. Describe the provisions relating to search of persons wrongfully confined.

**Introduction**

The right to personal liberty is a sacred fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, and any illegal restriction of this liberty is a serious offence. While a writ of *Habeas Corpus* is a constitutional remedy used in higher courts, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides a faster, more localized remedy for the rescue of individuals through **Section 100** (corresponding to Section 97 of the old CrPC). This section empowers a Magistrate to issue a search warrant for a person believed to be "wrongfully confined" under circumstances that amount to a criminal offence. The rationale is to provide an immediate "rescue mechanism" that bypassed the delays of a full-scale trial. Often termed as a "mini Habeas Corpus," Section 100 ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is extended to those who are unable to reach the law themselves because they are being held against their will.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Who can issue the Search Warrant?**

Under Section 100 of the BNSS, the power to issue a warrant for a wrongfully confined person is restricted to senior Magistrates:

* **District Magistrate (DM)**  
* **Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM)**  
* Magistrate of the First Class (JMIC)  
  A Magistrate of the Second Class does not have the authority to issue this specific warrant.

**2\. Condition Precedent: "Reason to Believe"**

The Magistrate cannot act on mere suspicion or whim. There must be a "reason to believe" that a person is confined under such circumstances that the confinement itself constitutes an offence (like wrongful restraint or kidnapping).

* *Example:* **Prateek** files an application in a court in **Lucknow**, stating that his sister, **Krishna**, is being kept in a locked room by her employer, **Kanishth**, and has not been allowed to leave for ten days. After a quick inquiry, Judge **Saurabh** (JMIC) forms a "reason to believe" that an offence is being committed and issues a search warrant under Section 100\.

**3\. Execution and Procedure of Search**

The person to whom the warrant is directed (usually a police officer) is authorized to search for the confined person in the manner described in the warrant.

* **Provisions of Search Apply:** The general rules of search, such as calling two independent witnesses (Section 103\) and the **mandatory audio-video recording** of the process (Section 105), apply to this search as well.  
* **Power to Break Open:** If the person in charge of the premises refuses entry, the officer has the legal authority to break open any door or window to rescue the victim.  
* *Example:* Officer **Raghavendra** reaches the house in **Lucknow**. He records the process on his mobile phone as he enters the premises. He finds **Krishna** locked in a room, rescues her, and documents her condition on video as per the new Sanhita's requirements.

**4\. Production before the Magistrate**

Once the wrongfully confined person is found and rescued, the law is very specific about the next step:

* **Immediate Production:** The person must be taken **immediately** before a Magistrate.  
* **Discretionary Order:** The Magistrate shall then make such an order as in the circumstances of the case seems proper. This could include sending the person home, to a shelter house, or recording their statement for the main criminal trial.  
* *Example:* After being rescued, **Krishna** is produced before Judge **Saurabh**. Finding that she is a victim of a crime, **Saurabh** ensures she is safely returned to **Prateek** and orders an FIR to be registered against **Kanishth**.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Section 100 of the **BNSS 2023** serves as a vital emergency tool in the hands of the district judiciary to protect individual liberty. By allowing Magistrates like **Saurabh** to act swiftly on credible information, the law ensures that victims of wrongful confinement in cities like **Indore** or **Varanasi** are rescued before any further harm occurs. The inclusion of mandatory videography under Section 105 adds a layer of transparency that prevents false claims of police high-handedness. Ultimately, this provision bridges the gap between the police's power to investigate and the court's duty to protect "Nagarik Suraksha," ensuring that the arm of the law reaches into the most private spaces to restore the freedom of a fellow citizen.

## Q23. Who can compel restoration of abducted females? Discuss the procedure which will be adopted by him?

**Introduction**

While Section 100 provides a rescue mechanism for anyone wrongfully confined, the law recognizes that women and children are uniquely vulnerable to abduction for specific illegal motives, such as forced marriage, trafficking, or other "unlawful purposes." Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this specialized power of rescue is governed by **Section 101** (corresponding to Section 98 of the old CrPC). The rationale behind this provision is to act as a fast-track remedy to restore the liberty of females and ensure they are returned to their safe environments or lawful guardians. Unlike a regular trial, which may take months, an order under Section 101 is aimed at the **immediate restoration** of the individual, treating the matter with the urgency it deserves.

---

**Main Body**

**1\. Who Can Exercise This Power?**

Only senior Magistrates are empowered to handle these sensitive cases under Section 101 of the BNSS:

* **District Magistrate (DM)**  
* **Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM)**  
* **Magistrate of the First Class (JMIC)**

**2\. Grounds for Action**

The process begins with a complaint made on oath. The Magistrate must be satisfied that:

* A woman or a female child (under the age of eighteen years) has been abducted or is being unlawfully detained.  
* The detention is for an **unlawful purpose** (such as exploitation or forced labor).  
* *Example:* In **Varanasi**, **Prateek** files a complaint on oath before Judge **Krishna** stating that a 16-year-old girl, **Meena**, has been abducted by a local gang for the purpose of being sold into trafficking.

**3\. The Nature of the Order**

Upon being satisfied with the complaint, the Magistrate may make an order for:

* **Immediate Restoration to Liberty:** If the victim is an adult woman.  
* Restoration to Parents/Guardians: If the victim is a female child under eighteen.  
  The Magistrate may also order the use of force if necessary to carry out the rescue.

**4\. Mandatory Audio-Video Recording (Section 105\)**

A critical new safeguard in the BNSS 2023 is that any search or seizure conducted to rescue the abducted female must be recorded through audio-video electronic means. This ensures that the rescue is documented, preventing any allegations of police misconduct or procedural lapses.

* *Example:* Officer **Saurabh** tracks down **Meena** in **Amritsar**. As he enters the premises to rescue her, he records the entire operation on a mobile phone. This recording serves as proof of the rescue and the condition in which **Meena** was found.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, **Section 101 of the BNSS 2023** provides a powerful shield for the protection of women and children in India. By focusing on "immediate restoration," the law bypasses procedural delays to prioritize human safety. The inclusion of modern technology via Section 105 reflects a 21st-century approach to "Nagarik Suraksha," ensuring that the rescue of vulnerable individuals like **Meena** is both transparent and legally sound. Whether it is a District Magistrate in **Lucknow** or a JMIC in **Indore**, the power to compel the restoration of abducted females ensures that the State remains the ultimate guardian of those most at risk.

---

## Q24. When can a police officer search a place within the limits of his own police station? What are the conditions of search?

**Introduction**

While specific warrants exist for stolen goods or confined persons, the law also provides a set of universal rules that apply to *every* search conducted by the authorities. These "General Provisions" ensure that a search is not a chaotic or private affair, but a disciplined legal procedure. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, these rules are found in **Sections 102 to 104**. The rationale is to protect the rights of the occupant while ensuring the integrity of the evidence. By mandating the presence of witnesses and providing for "free ingress," the law ensures that the search is transparent. Furthermore, the BNSS has introduced a revolutionary "Miscellaneous" provision in **Section 105**, which makes audio-video recording mandatory, bridging the gap between traditional policing and 21st-century technology for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection).

---

**Main Body**

### **General Provisions Relating to Searches (Sections 102–104)**

**1\. Direction of Search Warrants (Section 102\)**

This section clarifies that the general rules governing "Warrants of Arrest" (such as who they are directed to and how they are forwarded) also apply to "Search Warrants." This ensures consistency in how judicial orders are handled across district lines.

**2\. Procedure for Searching a Closed Place (Section 103\)**

This is the most practical part of search law. It requires:

* **Free Ingress:** Any person in charge of a closed place (like a house or office) must allow the officer entry upon being shown the warrant. If entry is refused, the officer may "break open" the door.  
* **Presence of Witnesses:** The officer **must** call upon two or more independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality to witness the search. The search must be conducted in their presence.  
* **The Search List (Seizure Memo):** A list of all things seized and the places where they were found must be prepared. This list must be signed by the witnesses. A copy of this list **must** be given to the occupant.  
* *Example:* Officer **Saurabh** searches **Kanishth’s** home in **Indore**. He asks two neighbors, **Prateek** and **Krishna**, to watch. **Saurabh** lists every item found, and **Prateek** and **Krishna** sign the list to confirm no evidence was "planted."

**3\. Disposal of Things Found Beyond Jurisdiction (Section 104\)**

When a search is conducted outside the district of the issuing court, the seized items, along with the list, must be taken immediately before the Court that issued the warrant, or a local Magistrate if the issuing Court is far away.

---

### **Mandatory Recording of Search and Seizure (Section 105\)**

The **BNSS 2023** has introduced a landmark provision in **Section 105** that fundamentally changes how police investigations are conducted in India.

**1\. Mandatory Audio-Video Recording**

Section 105 mandates that the entire process of conducting a search or taking possession of any property shall be recorded through any audio-video electronic means, preferably by a mobile phone.

* **Scope:** This includes the preparation of the seizure list and the signing of the list by the witnesses.  
* **The Rationale:** This move aims to eliminate allegations of police misconduct, "planting" of evidence, or coercion of witnesses. It provides "digital footprints" of the truth for the Court.

**2\. Timeline for Submission**

To prevent digital tampering, the law requires that the recording be forwarded to the Magistrate (District, Sub-divisional, or First Class) without delay. In cases where a search is conducted with a warrant, the recording must typically be submitted within 48 hours.

* *Example:* When Officer **Raghavendra** in **Lucknow** recovers a stolen vehicle, he records the entire recovery on his smartphone. He captures the engine number, the location, and the witnesses signing the memo. He then uploads or submits this video to Judge **Krishna**'s court immediately.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the general provisions under **Sections 102 to 105 of the BNSS 2023** represent a significant step toward a more transparent criminal justice system. While Sections 102–104 preserve the time-tested safeguards of witness presence and official lists, Section 105 acts as a modern "electronic witness." This synergy ensures that whether it is a routine search in **Patna** or a high-stakes seizure in **Amritsar**, the procedure remains "just, fair, and reasonable." For citizens like **Prateek** or **Kanishth**, these laws ensure that their privacy is only invaded under the strict gaze of both human witnesses and digital cameras, upholding the true spirit of "Nagarik Suraksha."

# UNIT-III: Inquiries Procedure

## 1\. Write Short notes on: 'Place of Inquiry or trial'

**Place of Inquiry or Trial**

**Introduction**

In the criminal justice system, determining "where" a case should be handled is as crucial as "how" it is handled. The concept of the "Place of Inquiry or Trial" refers to the territorial jurisdiction of a criminal court.1 Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the rules regarding jurisdiction are primarily contained in **Chapter XIV (Sections 197 to 209\)**.2 These provisions are designed to ensure that the legal process is convenient for witnesses, efficient for the police, and fair to the accused. The fundamental principle is that the court located nearest to the scene of the crime or the effect of the crime is best equipped to deliver justice.3 This ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is provided locally and effectively.

**Main Body**

The BNSS provides a set of rules to determine the correct court for different scenarios:4

* **Ordinary Place (Section 197):** The general rule is that every offence shall "ordinarily" be inquired into and tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed.5  
* *Example:* **Prateek** commits a theft in **Lucknow**. The case will ordinarily be tried by a Magistrate in **Lucknow**.  
* **Uncertain or Continuing Offences (Section 198):** If it is uncertain in which of several areas an offence was committed, or if it was committed partly in one area and partly in another, any court having jurisdiction over any of those areas can try the case.6  
* *Example:* **Kanishth** kidnaps **Krishna** in **Patna**, travels through **Varanasi**, and eventually detains her in **Bhopal**. The courts in **Patna**, **Varanasi**, or **Bhopal** all have the power to try **Kanishth**.  
* **Act and Consequence (Section 199):** When an act is an offence because of its consequence, the trial can happen where the act was done or where the consequence happened.7  
* *Example:* **Saurabh** strikes **Satyam** in **Indore**, but **Satyam** eventually passes away due to the injury in a hospital in **Mumbai**. The trial can take place in either **Indore** or **Mumbai**.  
* **Offences by Electronic Communication (Section 202):** A modern update in BNSS 2023 clarifies that for offences like cheating committed via electronic messages or letters, the trial can occur where the messages were sent or received.8  
* *Example:* **Sachkeerat** sends a fraudulent email from **Amritsar** to **Laukendra** in **Jaipur**, tricking him into sending money. The case can be tried in **Amritsar** or **Jaipur**.  
* **Related Offences (Section 200):** If an act is an offence because of its relation to another offence (like abetment or receiving stolen property), it can be tried where either act was done.9  
* *Example:* **Raghavendra** helps **Kanishth** hide stolen goods in **Pune**, which were originally stolen by **Kanishth** in **Mumbai**. Both can be tried in **Mumbai** or **Pune**.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the rules regarding the place of inquiry or trial in the **BNSS 2023** are practical and flexible. They prevent jurisdictional disputes from stalling the wheels of justice.10 By allowing multiple venues for continuing crimes or consequences, the law ensures that criminals like **Kanishth** cannot escape through legal loopholes. For citizens like **Prateek** and **Sachkeerat**, these rules provide a clear framework for where they must seek or face justice, balancing the administrative needs of the State with the rights of individuals in cities across India.

## 2\. Write Short notes on: 'Offence Committed on Journey or Voyage'.

**Offence Committed on Journey or Voyage**

**Introduction**

A crime committed in a fixed location is easy to map to a specific court, but what happens when a crime occurs on a moving train, a bus, or an aircraft? In a vast country like India, a person might travel through several districts or states in a single day. If a theft or assault occurs during such a journey, it might be impossible for the victim to determine the exact kilometer or the specific local jurisdiction where the act took place. To solve this practical problem, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides a special rule under **Section 203** (corresponding to Section 183 of the old CrPC). The rationale is to ensure that the "mobility" of the crime does not become a hurdle for the victim or a shield for the criminal, allowing "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) to be accessible along the entire route of the journey.

**Main Body**

Under **Section 203** of the BNSS, when an offence is committed while the victim, the accused, or the property in question is in the course of performing a journey or voyage, the offence may be inquired into or tried by any Court through or into whose local jurisdiction that person or thing passed during that journey. This rule creates a "continuous jurisdiction" along the path of travel.

* **Journey by Train:** Suppose **Prateek** is traveling on a train from **New Delhi** to **Mumbai**. During the night, while the train is moving, **Kanishth** steals **Prateek's** laptop. Because the train passes through various districts, **Prateek** does not need to identify the exact spot. The case can be tried by a court in **New Delhi**, **Mumbai**, or any station in between like **Kota** or **Ratlam** where the train passed.  
* **Journey by Bus:** **Krishna** is traveling on a bus from **Ahmedabad** to **Pune**. Near the border, **Saurabh** misbehaves with her. Since the bus is in motion and crosses multiple local limits, the courts in **Ahmedabad**, **Pune**, or any district the bus traversed have the authority to handle the case.  
* **Voyage or Long Distance Travel:** **Laukendra** is on a ship from **Kochi** to **Kolkata**. If **Sachkeerat** assaults him on the high seas, the court at the destination in **Kolkata** can take cognizance. Similarly, if **Raghavendra**, a police officer at a transit point, receives a complaint from **Satyam** about a crime on a long-distance bus, he cannot refuse it based on territory.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions for offences committed on a journey or voyage under the **BNSS 2023** are a vital necessity for a mobile society. By providing an expansive jurisdiction, the law ensures that victims like **Prateek** and **Krishna** are not forced to hunt for the exact spot of the crime in an unfamiliar district. It empowers officers and magistrates to take immediate action at any point along the route or at the destination. Ultimately, this rule ensures that justice travels with the citizen and that criminals like **Kanishth** cannot escape accountability simply because the wheels of the vehicle kept turning during the commission of the crime.

## 3\. Write Short notes on: Cognizance of offences by Court of Session (2019)

**Cognizance of offences by Court of Session**

**Introduction**

In the hierarchy of the Indian criminal judiciary, the Court of Session is the highest trial court in a district, empowered to try the most serious offences like murder or dacoity. However, unlike a Magistrate's Court, a Court of Session does not typically have the power to take "original cognizance"—meaning it cannot start a case directly from an FIR or a complaint. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the rule for initiating proceedings in this court is governed by **Section 213** (corresponding to Section 193 of the old CrPC). The rationale behind this is to provide a "judicial filter." Since the Court of Session handles grave matters, a Magistrate first examines the case to ensure there is enough substance before "committing" it to the higher court. This ensures that the valuable time of the Sessions Judge is reserved for trials that genuinely require such high-level scrutiny.

**Main Body**

The procedure and exceptions for cognizance by a Court of Session are as follows:

* **The General Rule (Committal):** Under **Section 213**, no Court of Session can take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been **committed** to it by a Magistrate. The Magistrate "takes cognizance" first, performs preliminary formalities, and then sends the file up.  
  *Example:* **Kanishth** is accused of a serious crime in **Lucknow**. The police file a charge sheet before a Magistrate. The Magistrate, **Raghavendra**, reviews the documents and realizes the offence is exclusively triable by the Sessions Court. **Raghavendra** then "commits" the case to the Court of Session where **Saurabh** is the Sessions Judge. Only then can **Saurabh** take cognizance and start the trial.  
* **The Exception (Direct Cognizance):** The only time a Court of Session can take cognizance directly (without a committal from a Magistrate) is when the Sanhita or any other law specifically allows it.  
* **Defamation of Public Servants (Section 221):** A major exception is provided in **Section 221** (old Section 199(2)). If a person like **Satyam** is accused of defaming high-ranking public officials (like the President, Vice-President, or a Minister) in respect of their official duties, the Court of Session can take cognizance directly upon a written complaint by the Public Prosecutor.  
  *Example:* **Laukendra** makes a defamatory statement against a Minister in **Varanasi**. The Public Prosecutor, **Sachkeerat**, files a direct complaint in the Court of Session. In this specific case, the Sessions Judge can start the proceedings without a Magistrate's involvement.  
* **Procedural Transparency:** Once the case is committed, **Section 248** of the BNSS mandates that the trial must be conducted by a Public Prosecutor, ensuring the state's oversight in these serious matters.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the Court of Session acts as a specialized forum for the most impactful criminal cases. By following the "committal route" under **Section 213 of the BNSS 2023**, the law ensures that cases are properly vetted by Magistrates like **Raghavendra** before they reach the Sessions Judge. This hierarchical approach maintains the efficiency of the district judiciary. While exceptions like the prosecution for defamation of high officials under Section 221 allow for a direct path, the standard procedure remains the backbone of "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), ensuring that serious allegations against citizens like **Kanishth** are handled with the highest degree of judicial care and procedural integrity.

## 4\. Write Short notes on: Prosecution for Defamation

**Prosecution for Defamation**

**Introduction**

Defamation is a unique offence because it primarily targets a person's reputation, which the law considers as valuable as their physical safety. Under the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023**, the definition and punishment for defamation are found in **Section 356**. The procedure to prosecute this offence is specifically laid out in **Section 222** of the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**. Unlike most crimes where the police can take action, defamation is mostly treated as a private wrong. The fundamental principle is that the "State" does not interfere unless the person whose reputation is harmed comes forward to complain. This ensures that the courts are only used for genuine grievances regarding personal dignity.

**Main Body**

The BNSS provides clear rules on who can initiate a case for defamation:

* **General Rule (Aggrieved Person):** No Court shall take cognizance of defamation except upon a complaint made by the "person aggrieved" by the offence.  
  *Example:* **Kanishth** spreads a rumor in **Patna** that **Prateek** has cheated in his business. Only **Prateek** has the right to file a complaint against **Kanishth**. If **Satyam**, who is **Prateek’s** friend, tries to file the case, the court will refuse it.  
* **Exceptions for Vulnerable Persons:** If the defamed person is a child (under 18), is of unsound mind, is too sick or infirm to file a complaint, or is a woman who by custom should not appear in public, the court may allow someone else to file the complaint on their behalf.  
  *Example:* **Krishna** is a minor in **Indore** who is defamed by an anonymous poster. Her guardian, **Raghavendra**, can file the complaint with the permission of the court.  
* **Special Case for High Officials:** If the person defamed is the President, Vice-President, a Governor, or a Minister regarding their official conduct, a **Public Prosecutor** like **Saurabh** can file a direct complaint in the Court of Session.  
* **Conditions for Public Servants:** For the Public Prosecutor to act, they must obtain prior "sanction" (permission) from the Government. Also, such a complaint must be filed within **six months** of the incident.  
  *Example:* **Laukendra** makes a defamatory statement against a Minister in **Lucknow**. The Public Prosecutor, **Sachkeerat**, after getting government permission, files a direct case in the Sessions Court within the six-month deadline.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the prosecution for defamation under the **BNSS 2023** creates a balanced path for seeking justice. By making the "aggrieved person" rule mandatory, it prevents people from using the law to settle scores on behalf of others. At the same time, the special procedure for high-ranking officials ensures that the dignity of the State's offices is protected. Whether it is a private individual like **Prateek** defending his name or a public official being defended by **Sachkeerat**, the law ensures that reputation is protected through a transparent and specific judicial process in cities across India.

## 5\. Write Short notes on: Examination or complainant.

**Examination of Complainant**

**Introduction**

The "Examination of Complainant" is the first judicial filter applied to a private criminal complaint to prevent the misuse of the legal system. In the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this is governed by **Section 223** (which replaces Section 200 of the old CrPC). The primary objective is to verify the truthfulness of the allegations before the court officially takes notice of the crime. Under the new Sanhita, this stage has been significantly strengthened by making it a mandatory pre-cognizance safeguard. This ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) applies not only to the victim seeking justice but also to the accused who might otherwise face harassment from frivolous or malicious litigation.

**Main Body**

Under **Section 223**, a Magistrate who has jurisdiction over a case must follow a strict procedure when a private complaint is filed:

* **Examination on Oath:** The Magistrate is legally bound to examine the complainant and any witnesses present under oath. This means the person must swear to tell the truth, making them liable for perjury if they lie.  
* **Recording and Signing:** The substance of this examination must be reduced to writing and signed by the complainant, the witnesses, and the Magistrate.  
  *Example:* **Prateek** files a private complaint against **Kanishth** in **Lucknow** for criminal breach of trust. Magistrate **Raghavendra** calls **Prateek** to the stand and examines him and his witness, **Krishna**, on oath. **Raghavendra** writes down their statements, and all of them sign the document.  
* **The New "Hearing" Safeguard:** A revolutionary update in the BNSS 2023 is the requirement that no cognizance shall be taken without giving the accused an opportunity of being heard.  
  *Example:* In the same case in **Lucknow**, before **Raghavendra** decides to officially start the case, he must give **Kanishth** a chance to explain his version. This prevents **Kanishth** from being summoned unnecessarily if the case is clearly false.  
* **Special Protection for Public Servants:** If the complaint is against a public servant like **Saurabh** for acts done in official duty, the Magistrate must get a report from his superior, **Sachkeerat**, and allow **Saurabh** to make assertions before proceeding.  
* **Exceptions:** If the complaint is made by a public servant like **Laukendra** in his official capacity or by a Court, the Magistrate does not need to examine them. Similarly, if the case is transferred to Magistrate **Satyam**, he may rely on the previous examination.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the examination of the complainant under **Section 223 of the BNSS 2023** acts as a robust judicial screen. By recording statements under oath and introducing a mandatory hearing for the accused, the law ensures that only genuine cases proceed to trial. This protects the dignity of individuals in cities from **Patna** to **Amritsar**, ensuring that for every **Prateek** seeking a legal remedy, there is a shield for every **Kanishth** against false accusations. This balanced approach upholds the principles of natural justice and ensures the integrity of the criminal justice system from its very inception.

## 6\. Write Short notes on: Issue of Process (2019)

**Issue of Process**

**Introduction**

The "Issue of Process" is the decisive stage in a criminal proceeding where the Court, after preliminary examination, decides to officially summon the accused to face trial. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this stage is governed by **Section 227** (corresponding to Section 204 of the old CrPC). It marks the transition from a mere "complaint" to an active "judicial case." The rationale behind this provision is to ensure that no person is subjected to the burden of a criminal trial unless a Magistrate is satisfied that there is "sufficient ground" for proceeding. It serves as the final gateway, ensuring that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is maintained by preventing the harassment of innocent individuals while ensuring that suspected offenders are brought before the law.

**Main Body**

Once a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence and finds sufficient grounds, they "issue process" using the following methods:

* **Summons Cases:** If the case is a "summons-case" (typically minor offences), the Magistrate shall issue a **summons** for the attendance of the accused.  
  *Example:* **Prateek** is accused of a minor neighborhood nuisance in **Lucknow**. Magistrate **Raghavendra** finds sufficient evidence and issues a summons to **Prateek**, politely requiring him to appear in court on a specific date.  
* **Warrant Cases:** If it is a "warrant-case" (serious offences), the Magistrate may issue a **warrant** or a summons, depending on what is necessary to ensure the accused appears.  
  *Example:* **Kanishth** is accused of a serious robbery in **Patna**. Given the gravity, Magistrate **Saurabh** decides to issue a warrant of arrest directly to ensure **Kanishth** does not flee.  
* **Condition Precedent (Witness List):** A process cannot be issued against the accused until a list of prosecution witnesses has been filed. This ensures that the accused, like **Satyam**, knows who will be testifying against them.  
* **Payment of Fees:** If any law requires the payment of "process-fees" (for serving the summons), the process will not be issued until the fees are paid. If **Krishna** fails to pay the fee for her complaint in **Indore**, the case may be dismissed.  
* **The "Hearing" Requirement (New in BNSS):** Consistent with Section 223, before issuing a process in a private complaint, the Magistrate must ensure that the accused has been given an opportunity of being heard.  
  *Example:* Before Magistrate **Satyam** issues a warrant for **Laukendra** in **Varanasi**, he must review the assertions made by **Laukendra** to ensure the case isn't a malicious fabrication by **Sachkeerat**.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the "Issue of Process" under **Section 227 of the BNSS 2023** is a critical exercise of judicial discretion. It ensures that the machinery of the State is not used as a tool for personal vendettas. By distinguishing between summons and warrants, the law applies a proportionate amount of force based on the nature of the crime. For citizens across India—from **Amritsar** to **Indore**—this stage guarantees that their liberty is only restricted when a judicial mind like **Raghavendra** or **Saurabh** finds a valid reason to do so. This procedure remains the bedrock of a fair trial, ensuring that the accused is brought to court through a transparent and "just" process.

Long Answer Type Question

## Q1. Discuss the Jurisdiction of Criminal Courts in respect of Inquiries and Trials. (2022)

**Jurisdiction of Criminal Courts in respect of Inquiries and Trials**

**Introduction**

Jurisdiction is the legal authority of a court to hear, try, and decide a case.1 In criminal law, territorial jurisdiction is fundamental as it determines "where" a case should be initiated and conducted.2 The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides the legal framework for this in **Chapter XIV (Sections 197 to 209\)**.3 The primary purpose of these jurisdictional rules is to ensure the convenience of the parties, the efficiency of the investigation, and the fairness of the trial.4 By ensuring that a case is tried in a court that has a logical and practical connection to the offence, the BNSS facilitates the effective administration of justice and upholds the principle of "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection).5 Whether an offence is committed in a single city, across multiple districts, or even outside the country, the BNSS provides a clear roadmap to identify the competent court.6

**Main Body**

The BNSS 2023 establishes several principles to determine the place of inquiry or trial depending on the nature and circumstances of the crime:7

**1\. The General Rule: Ordinary Place of Inquiry and Trial (Section 197)8**

The basic principle is that every offence shall "ordinarily" be inquired into and tried by a Court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed.9 This proximity ensures that the court is close to the evidence, witnesses, and the crime scene.10

*Example:* **Prateek** commits a robbery at a bank in **Lucknow**. Under Section 197, the Court in **Lucknow** has the ordinary jurisdiction to try **Prateek**.

**2\. Place of Inquiry or Trial in Cases of Uncertainty (Section 198\)**

When it is uncertain which of several local areas an offence was committed in, or if it was committed partly in one area and partly in another, or if it is a continuing offence, any court having jurisdiction over any of those areas can try the case.11

*Example:* **Kanishth** kidnaps **Krishna** in **Patna**, travels through **Varanasi**, and detains her in **Bhopal**. The courts in **Patna**, **Varanasi**, and **Bhopal** all have jurisdiction to try **Kanishth**.

**3\. Act Done or Consequence Ensues (Section 199)12**

When an act is an offence because of the act itself and the consequence that follows, the trial can take place where the act was done or where the consequence happened.13

*Example:* **Saurabh** assaults **Satyam** in **Indore**, but **Satyam** eventually dies from the injuries in a hospital in **Mumbai**. The trial for culpable homicide can be held in either **Indore** or **Mumbai**.

**4\. Relation to Other Offences (Section 200)14**

If an act is an offence because of its relation to another offence (like abetment or receiving stolen property), it can be tried in the court where either act was committed.15

*Example:* **Raghavendra** abets a crime committed by **Sachkeerat** in **Amritsar**. **Raghavendra** can be tried in the court where he provided the abetment or in **Amritsar** where the main crime occurred.

**5\. Jurisdiction for Specific Offences (Section 201)16**

The Sanhita specifies venues for certain crimes to prevent jurisdictional loopholes:17

* **Dacoity/Escaping Custody:** Where the offence was committed or where the accused is found.18  
* **Kidnapping/Abduction:** Where the person was taken, conveyed, or concealed.19  
* **Theft/Extortion:** Where the crime happened or where the stolen property was possessed or received.20  
* **Criminal Breach of Trust:** Where the property was received, retained, or required to be returned.21

**6\. Electronic Communications and Cheating (Section 202)22**

In the digital age, the BNSS explicitly addresses crimes committed via technology. Offences involving cheating practised through electronic communications, letters, or telecommunication messages can be tried where the messages were sent or received.23

*Example:* **Laukendra** sends a fraudulent email from **Jaipur** to **Prateek** in **Kolkata**, tricking him into a financial scam. The case can be tried in **Jaipur** or **Kolkata**.

**7\. Journey or Voyage (Section 203)24**

When an offence is committed on a moving vehicle (train, bus, ship, or aircraft), any court through whose jurisdiction the person or thing passed during the journey has jurisdiction.25

*Example:* **Sachkeerat** is robbed while on a train from **Delhi** to **Chennai**. The case can be tried at any station the train passed through or at the destination.

**8\. Offences Committed Outside India (Section 208)26**

When an Indian citizen commits an offence outside India, or a person on an Indian ship/aircraft commits one, they can be dealt with as if the offence had been committed at any place in India where they may be found, provided the Central Government gives its sanction.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the jurisdiction of criminal courts regarding inquiries and trials under the **BNSS 2023** is designed to be comprehensive and adaptable. By providing specific rules for various scenarios—ranging from simple local thefts to complex cross-border electronic frauds—the law ensures that no criminal can escape trial due to technicalities of territory. For individuals like **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**, these provisions guarantee that the judicial process is conducted in a venue that is legally appropriate and practically convenient. The overarching goal is the "Nagarik Suraksha," ensuring that the wheels of justice turn smoothly and efficiently in every corner of India, from **Patna** to **Mumbai**, by grounding the legal authority of the court in the most relevant and effective location.

~~What do you understand by the cognizance of an offence by a Magistrate ? Discuss the procedure in detail. (2024)~~

## Q3. Explain briefly the limitations imposed by the sanhita on the unfettered powers of Magistrates to take cognizance of offences under section 210\.

**Limitations on the Powers of Magistrates to Take Cognizance (Section 210 BNSS)**

**Introduction**

The power to take cognizance of an offence is the point at which a Magistrate officially "takes judicial notice" of a crime and decides whether there is sufficient ground to proceed. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this power is granted by **Section 210** (corresponding to Section 190 of the old CrPC). While this section gives Magistrates the authority to act on a complaint, a police report, or their own knowledge, this power is not "unfettered" or absolute. The Sanhita imposes several limitations and conditions to ensure that the judicial process is not used for harassment or to settle personal scores. These limitations act as safeguards, ensuring that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is maintained by allowing only legally valid and properly sanctioned cases to enter the courtroom.

**Main Body**

The limitations on a Magistrate's power to take cognizance can be categorized into procedural, territorial, and statutory restrictions:

* **Territorial Jurisdiction (Sections 197–209):** A Magistrate cannot take cognizance of just any crime in the country. They must have "local jurisdiction" over the area where the offence was committed or where the consequence happened.  
  *Example:* **Raghavendra**, a Magistrate in **Patna**, cannot take cognizance of a minor theft committed by **Kanishth** in **Lucknow** unless the stolen property is found in **Patna** or another legal link exists under Sections 198–203.  
* **Period of Limitation (Sections 513–519):** For less serious offences, the BNSS imposes a "time bar." A Magistrate is prohibited from taking cognizance after the expiry of the period of limitation (e.g., 6 months for fine-only offences, 1 year for offences punishable up to 1 year).  
  *Example:* **Sachkeerat** defames **Saurabh** in **Amritsar** (punishable up to 2 years). If **Saurabh** waits for 4 years to file a complaint, Magistrate **Krishna** cannot take cognizance as the 3-year limitation period has expired.  
* **Prior Sanction for Public Servants (Section 218):** A significant limitation exists when the accused is a judge or a public servant. A Magistrate cannot take cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed in the discharge of their official duties without prior "sanction" (permission) from the State or Central Government.  
  *Example:* **Laukendra**, a police officer in **Indore**, is accused by **Satyam** of using excessive force during a lawful arrest. Magistrate **Prateek** cannot take cognizance unless the government grants permission to prosecute **Laukendra**.  
* **Offences Against Marriage (Section 217):** For offences like bigamy or adultery, a Magistrate can only take cognizance upon a complaint made by the "person aggrieved" (usually the spouse).  
* **Opportunity to be Heard (Section 223 \- New Reform):** A major new limitation in the **BNSS 2023** is that for private complaints, the Magistrate shall not take cognizance without giving the accused an opportunity of being heard. This prevents the "unfettered" issuance of summons based on one-sided stories.  
* **Forensic and Reporting Barriers:** For serious offences, the Magistrate must ensure that forensic procedures (under Section 176\) were followed, and for complaints against public servants, a report from a superior officer must be received before acting.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, while **Section 210 of the BNSS 2023** provides the engine for initiating criminal proceedings, the limitations spread across the Sanhita provide the "brakes." These restrictions ensure that Magistrates like **Krishna** or **Prateek** apply their judicial minds within the boundaries of territorial jurisdiction, time limits, and government sanctions. By introducing the mandatory hearing of the accused even at the cognizance stage, the BNSS has significantly curtailed the possibility of arbitrary or "unfettered" judicial action. These safeguards ensure that the rights of citizens like **Saurabh** or **Laukendra** are protected against frivolous litigation, keeping the judicial process "just, fair, and reasonable" in every district of India, from **Patna** to **Lucknow**.

**Complaint and the Process of Taking Cognizance**

**Introduction**

In the framework of criminal justice, a "Complaint" is the primary bridge between a private citizen and the power of the Judiciary. While most criminal cases are initiated by the police through an FIR, the law recognizes that citizens must have a direct channel to seek justice when the police fail to act or when the matter is of a private nature. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the definition of a complaint and the subsequent procedure for "taking cognizance" have been refined to enhance transparency and protect against malicious litigation. The process of cognizance is the first "judicial act" where a Magistrate applies their mind to the facts to determine if a legal proceeding should be initiated. By establishing strict procedures under **Sections 223 and 224**, the BNSS ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is provided through a balanced approach that respects the rights of both the complainant and the accused.

**Main Body**

**1\. Defining a Complaint (Section 2(h))**

According to Section 2(h) of the BNSS, a "complaint" means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under this Sanhita, that some person (known or unknown) has committed an offence.

* **Crucial Exclusion:** It specifically excludes a police report.  
* **The "Police Report" Exception:** If a police officer investigates a case and finds that only a **non-cognizable** offence was committed, their final report is "deemed" to be a complaint, and the officer is treated as the complainant.

*Example:* **Prateek** goes to Magistrate **Raghavendra** in **Lucknow** and states in writing that **Kanishth** has cheated him of money. This is a complaint. However, if Officer **Saurabh** files a chargesheet after an FIR, that is a "police report," not a complaint.

**2\. Understanding "Taking Cognizance" (Section 210\)**

"Taking cognizance" does not mean convicting someone; it simply means "taking judicial notice." It is the moment the Magistrate decides there is enough "prima facie" evidence to move the case forward. The Magistrate takes cognizance under Section 210 upon receiving a complaint, a police report, or information from any other person.

*Example:* When Magistrate **Raghavendra** reads **Prateek's** complaint and decides to examine him under oath to see if a crime really happened, he is said to have "taken cognizance."

**3\. Procedure on Receiving a Complaint (Section 223\)**

The BNSS 2023 has introduced a revolutionary change in this procedure:

* **Examination on Oath:** The Magistrate must examine the complainant (**Prateek**) and any witnesses (like **Krishna**) on oath. The substance is written down and signed.  
* **Mandatory Hearing of the Accused (The New Shield):** Unlike the old law, the new proviso to Section 223(1) states that no cognizance shall be taken without giving the accused (**Kanishth**) an opportunity to be heard.  
* **14-Day Timeline:** The preliminary inquiry to decide on cognizance should ideally be completed within 14 days.

**4\. Procedure When Magistrate is Not Competent (Section 224\)**

If Prateek files his complaint before Magistrate Satyam, but the offence actually happened in a different jurisdiction or is beyond Satyam's power:

* **Written Complaint:** **Satyam** will return the complaint to **Prateek** for presentation to the proper Court with an "endorsement" (a note) to that effect.  
* **Oral Complaint:** **Satyam** will simply direct **Prateek** to the correct Court.

**5\. Referring the Case to the Police (Section 175(3))**

Yes, a Magistrate can refer a complaint to the police. Under Section 175(3) (formerly 156(3)), if the complaint discloses a cognizable offence, the Magistrate, before taking cognizance, can order the police to investigate. This effectively turns the private complaint into an FIR-based investigation.

*Example:* If **Prateek's** complaint involves a serious robbery, Magistrate **Raghavendra** might tell Officer **Saurabh** to "investigate the matter" instead of handling it as a private complaint trial.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the journey from a private "Complaint" to the "Issue of Process" is governed by a set of precise judicial checkpoints in the **BNSS 2023**. By defining a complaint clearly and introducing a mandatory pre-cognizance hearing for the accused, the law creates a robust filter against frivolous cases. For citizens in cities like **Lucknow** or **Patna**, these rules ensure that while victims like **Prateek** have a path to justice, individuals like **Kanishth** are protected from arbitrary judicial action. Whether a Magistrate takes the case themselves or refers it to the police under Section 175(3), the ultimate goal remains "Nagarik Suraksha"—the protection of every citizen through a transparent and accountable legal procedure.

## Q5. What are those steps which a Magistrate is required to take after being satisfied on a complaint that there is sufficient ground for proceeding?

**Steps Taken by a Magistrate After Being Satisfied on a Complaint (Section 227 BNSS)**

**Introduction**

Once a Magistrate has completed the initial stages of a complaint—such as the examination of the complainant and witnesses and the mandatory pre-cognizance hearing—they must decide whether the case has enough merit to continue. If the Magistrate, after judicial application of mind, concludes that there is "sufficient ground for proceeding," they move into the stage of "Commencement of Proceedings." Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this is primarily governed by **Section 227** (corresponding to Section 204 of the old CrPC). This stage, known as the "Issue of Process," is the point where the court officially summons the accused to answer the allegations. The rationale is to transition the matter from a private dispute to a formal judicial trial, ensuring "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) by providing a clear and structured procedure to bring the accused before the law.

**Main Body**

According to Section 227 of the BNSS, the Magistrate must take several specific steps and follow certain mandatory conditions when they are satisfied that a case should proceed:

**1\. Choosing the Correct Process (Summons vs. Warrant)**

The Magistrate’s first duty is to determine the nature of the case to decide how to compel the accused's appearance:

* **Summons-Cases:** In a summons-case (offences punishable with imprisonment up to 2 years), the Magistrate **shall** issue a summons for the attendance of the accused.  
* **Warrant-Cases:** In a warrant-case (serious offences punishable with death, life imprisonment, or more than 2 years), the Magistrate **may** issue a warrant or, if they think fit, a summons.

*Example:* **Prateek** files a complaint in **Lucknow** against **Kanishth** for a minor assault. Magistrate **Raghavendra** finds sufficient ground and issues a summons to **Kanishth**. However, if **Satyam** files a complaint against **Sachkeerat** for a serious robbery in **Amritsar**, **Raghavendra** might issue a warrant for **Sachkeerat's** arrest to ensure he does not abscond.

**2\. The Mandatory "Witness List" Condition (Section 227(2))**

A significant safeguard in the BNSS is that the Magistrate cannot issue a summons or warrant until the prosecution has filed a list of its witnesses. This prevents the accused from being blindsided and ensures the case is ready for trial.

*Example:* In **Patna**, before Magistrate **Saurabh** issues a process against **Laukendra**, the complainant **Krishna** must submit a list of individuals who will testify against him.

**3\. Accompanying Complaint Copy (Section 227(3))**

In proceedings instituted upon a written complaint, every summons or warrant issued must be accompanied by a copy of the complaint. This fulfills the constitutional right of the accused to know the exact nature of the allegations against them.

*Example:* When the postman delivers the summons to **Kanishth** in **Varanasi**, the envelope must also contain the written complaint filed by **Prateek**.

**4\. Electronic Service of Process**

A modern update in the BNSS 2023 is the explicit provision that summons or warrants may also be issued through electronic means, such as encrypted email or messaging apps. This speeds up the delivery of justice in a digital world.

**5\. Payment of Process Fees (Section 227(4))**

If any law requires fees for issuing the summons or warrant, they must be paid by the complainant. If Prateek fails to pay these fees within a reasonable time, Magistrate Raghavendra has the power to dismiss the complaint.

**6\. Dispensing with Personal Attendance (Section 228\)**

If the Magistrate issues a summons, they have the discretion under Section 228 to permit the accused to appear through a legal pleader instead of coming in person, especially if the case is minor or the accused is infirm.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the steps a Magistrate takes under **Section 227 of the BNSS 2023** are designed to ensure a smooth transition from an allegation to a formal trial. By mandating the filing of a witness list and the provision of a complaint copy, the law protects the rights of the accused from the very start. The flexibility to choose between a summons and a warrant ensures that the level of compulsion is proportionate to the severity of the crime. For citizens in cities like **Indore** or **Lucknow**, these procedures act as a vital filter, ensuring that judicial resources are only used for cases where "sufficient ground" exists, thereby upholding the integrity of "Nagarik Suraksha" in the Indian legal system.

## Q6. Write a short note on: (i) Commitment of case to Court of Session and (ii) Consolidation of cases relating to the same offence.

**Commitment and Consolidation of Cases**

**Introduction**

In the Indian criminal justice system, the distribution of work between the Magistrate's Court and the Court of Session is strictly defined based on the severity of the offence. While a Magistrate handles a wide range of crimes, certain grave offences like murder or dacoity are reserved for the Court of Session. To facilitate this, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides for the "Commitment of Case" under **Section 232**. Furthermore, to prevent the confusion of parallel proceedings for the same incident—where both a private complaint and a police investigation are active—the Sanhita provides for "Consolidation of Cases" under **Section 233**. These procedures are essential for judicial efficiency and the protection of the rights of the accused. They ensure that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is not compromised by procedural delays or conflicting judgments, providing a streamlined path to justice for every citizen.

**Main Body**

**1\. Commitment of Case to Court of Session (Section 232\)**

The process of commitment, or "committal," acts as a legal bridge. When a Magistrate realizes that an offence is "triable exclusively by the Court of Session," they must transfer the entire case to the Sessions Judge.

* **The Procedure:** Under Section 232, once the accused appears, the Magistrate must:  
  * **Supply Documents:** Ensure compliance with Section 230 or 231 by providing the accused with copies of the FIR, police report, and witness statements.  
  * **Remand and Records:** Send the entire case record, evidence, and articles to the Sessions Court and remand the accused to custody or bail.  
  * **Notification:** Inform the Public Prosecutor about the transfer.  
* **The New Timeline:** A critical reform in the BNSS is the **90-day limit** to complete these committal proceedings, extendable up to 180 days only with written reasons.

*Example:* **Kanishth** is accused of a serious crime in **Varanasi**. Magistrate **Raghavendra** takes cognizance but realizes the case must be tried by the Sessions Court. **Raghavendra** provides all documents to **Kanishth**, remands him, and "commits" the case to Sessions Judge **Saurabh**.

**2\. Consolidation of Cases (Section 233\)**

Consolidation occurs when two different paths are taken for the same crime: a private "Complaint Case" and a "Police Investigation."

* **The Procedure:** Under Section 233, if a Magistrate is conducting an inquiry into a complaint and finds that a police investigation is also ongoing for the same matter:  
  * **Stay of Proceedings:** The Magistrate must stay (pause) the complaint case and call for a report from the police.  
  * **Joint Trial:** If the police report results in cognizance against the same accused, the Magistrate will try both cases together as if both were initiated on a police report.  
  * **Resumption:** If the police report does not relate to the accused, the Magistrate resumes the stayed complaint trial.

*Example:* **Prateek** files a private complaint against **Krishna** in **Lucknow**. Meanwhile, Officer **Laukendra** is also investigating **Krishna** for the same incident. Magistrate **Sachkeerat** stays **Prateek's** case. Once **Laukendra** files a chargesheet, **Sachkeerat** consolidates the two and tries them together to avoid conflicting outcomes.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions for commitment and consolidation in the **BNSS 2023** serve as vital administrative tools for the judiciary. By mandating the transfer of serious cases under Section 232, the law ensures that the highest level of judicial scrutiny is applied to grave crimes. Simultaneously, by merging parallel proceedings under Section 233, the Sanhita prevents the waste of judicial resources and protects citizens like **Krishna** from facing multiple trials for a single act. These procedural safeguards, supported by the new 90-day committal timeline, enhance the speed and reliability of trials in cities like **Varanasi** and **Lucknow**. Whether it is Judge **Saurabh** presiding over a committed case or Magistrate **Sachkeerat** consolidating a dual investigation, these rules ensure that the Indian legal system remains "just, fair, and reasonable."

## Q1. Discuss the procedure for security for keeping the peace on conviction.

**Security for Keeping the Peace on Conviction**

**Introduction**

The primary objective of the criminal justice system is not just to punish offenders but also to prevent future crimes and maintain public tranquility. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, specific provisions are laid out for "preventive justice." One of the most significant provisions is **Section 125** (corresponding to Section 106 of the old CrPC), which deals with "Security for keeping the peace on conviction." This section empowers the judiciary to demand a legal guarantee from a convicted person that they will not disturb the peace for a specified period after their sentence. The rationale is to suppress the criminal tendencies of an individual who has already shown a propensity for violence or disorder. By requiring a bond, the law ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) continues even after the immediate punishment for an offence has been served.

**Main Body**

The procedure for taking security for keeping the peace on conviction follows strict judicial guidelines:

* **Competent Courts:** Only high-level trial courts are empowered to pass such orders. These include the **Court of Session** or the **Court of a Magistrate of the First Class**. Additionally, an Appellate Court or a Court exercising powers of revision can also make such an order when upholding or modifying a conviction.  
* **Offences Requiring Security:** Not every conviction triggers this provision. It applies to offences that involve a threat to public peace, specifically:  
  * Offences under **Chapter XI** of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023** (Offences against Public Tranquility).  
  * Offences involving **assault**, **criminal force**, or **mischief**.  
  * Offences of **criminal intimidation**.  
  * Any other offence which caused, or was intended/likely to cause, a breach of peace.  
* **The Procedure:** The order is passed "at the time of passing sentence.” The court must form an opinion that it is necessary to take security from the offender to ensure they do not repeat the behavior.  
* *Example:* **Kanishth** is convicted by a Magistrate in **Patna** for using criminal force against **Krishna** during a public gathering. At the time of sentencing **Kanishth** to six months in jail, Judge **Raghavendra** also orders him to execute a bond for keeping the peace for two years after his release.  
* **Nature of the Bond:** The offender is required to execute a bond, with or without **sureties**. A surety is a person who guarantees the offender's good behavior and agrees to pay a penalty if the peace is breached.  
* *Example:* **Kanishth** asks his friend **Prateek** to stand as his surety in the **Patna** court. **Prateek** signs the bond, promising that **Kanishth** will maintain peace in the neighborhood of **Kankarbagh**.  
* **Duration:** The period for which such security can be demanded cannot exceed **three years**.  
* **Effect of Appeal:** If the underlying conviction is set aside on appeal or otherwise, the bond automatically becomes **void**.  
* *Example:* If **Kanishth** appeals his conviction to the Sessions Court and Judge **Saurabh** acquits him, the peace bond signed by **Kanishth** and **Prateek** becomes legally invalid immediately.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, **Section 125 of the BNSS 2023** serves as a vital tool for judicial oversight of convicted individuals. By allowing courts like those in **Patna** or **Lucknow** to demand security, the law creates a legal deterrent against recidivism. It bridges the gap between punishment and rehabilitation by placing a financial and moral obligation on the offender to remain peaceful. For citizens like **Krishna** and **Satyam**, this provision offers a sense of security, knowing that even after a criminal like **Kanishth** has served his time, the law continues to watch over his conduct to prevent a breach of public tranquility. This procedure is a cornerstone of the State's mission to ensure a safe and orderly society.

## Q2. Discuss the preventive measures provided in Chapter IX of the new Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita mentioning provisions relating to (i) bond for keeping peace, (ii) security for good behaviour.

Or

Explain the procedure adopted by the Magistrate under B.N.S.S. relating to security for keeping the peace and for good behaviour. (2022)

**Preventive Measures under Chapter IX of BNSS 2023**

**Introduction**

The philosophy of "prevention is better than cure" is deeply embedded in the criminal justice system through the power of preventive justice. While most laws deal with punishment after a crime is committed, **Chapter IX of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023 (Sections 125 to 143\)**, focuses on stopping potential crimes before they happen. This chapter empowers Magistrates to take security from individuals who are likely to disturb the peace or who have a track record of criminal behavior. The objective is not to punish but to safeguard the community. By requiring a person to execute a bond, the law places them under a legal obligation to maintain order. This chapter is a vital tool for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), ensuring that public tranquility is maintained in every corner of India, from **Lucknow** to **Bhopal**.

**Main Body**

The preventive measures in Chapter IX are divided into two main categories: bonds for keeping the peace and security for good behavior.

1\. Bond for Keeping Peace in Other Cases (Section 126\)

Unlike Section 125 (which applies after conviction), Section 126 allows an Executive Magistrate to act when no crime has yet been proven, but a breach of peace is apprehended.

* **Trigger:** The Magistrate must receive information that a person is likely to commit a breach of peace or disturb public tranquility.  
* **Procedure:** The Magistrate issues a "show cause" notice, asking the person why they should not be required to sign a bond.  
* **Duration:** The security can be demanded for a period not exceeding **one year**.

*Example:* In **Lucknow**, **Prateek** and **Kanishth** have a heated dispute over a boundary wall. The local police report that they are likely to fight. Magistrate **Raghavendra** issues a notice to both, requiring them to execute a bond for keeping the peace for six months to ensure the situation doesn't turn violent.

2\. Security for Good Behaviour (Sections 127–129)

Security for good behavior is more stringent and is directed at specific categories of people whose conduct suggests a higher risk to society.

* **Section 127 (Disseminating Certain Matters):** This applies to persons spreading seditious matters, content that promotes enmity between groups, or defamatory matter concerning a Judge. The duration is up to **one year**.  
  *Example:* **Satyam** is found distributing pamphlets in **Varanasi** that incite communal tension. Magistrate **Saurabh** can require him to provide security for his good behavior for a year.  
* **Section 128 (Suspected Persons):** This targets individuals who are found taking precautions to conceal their presence within the Magistrate's jurisdiction with a view to committing a cognizable offence. The duration is up to **one year**.  
  *Example:* **Laukendra** is spotted hiding in an abandoned building in **Indore** at midnight with house-breaking tools. Magistrate **Krishna** can demand security for his good behavior.  
* **Section 129 (Habitual Offenders):** This is the most serious preventive measure. It applies to people who are habitual robbers, house-breakers, thieves, or those who commit offences involving a breach of peace repeatedly.  
* **Duration for Habitual Offenders:** Because of their history, the security can be demanded for a period up to **three years**.  
  *Example:* **Sachkeerat** has been arrested multiple times for snatching in **Amritsar**. To protect the citizens, Magistrate **Satyam** orders him to execute a bond for good behavior for three years.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the preventive measures provided in **Chapter IX of the BNSS 2023** are essential for maintaining public order and tranquility. By providing a graduated system of bonds—from simple peace bonds under Section 126 to long-term security for habitual offenders under Section 129—the law ensures that the State can respond proportionately to different levels of threat. For citizens like **Krishna** and **Prateek**, these provisions act as a silent shield, preventing potential harm before it occurs. Whether it is a local dispute in **Lucknow** or a habitual offender in **Amritsar**, the judicial and executive oversight provided by these sections ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" remains the highest priority of the Indian legal system.

## Q3. 'A' a person has been reported to be of bad character and has been arrested for executing a bond for maintaining good behaviour. On inquiry the allegations are found incorrect. Will he still be required to execute the bond for keeping peace?

**Discharge of a Person When Allegations are Incorrect**

**Introduction**

The preventive provisions of the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, are designed to be a shield for society, not a sword for the harassment of individuals. When a Magistrate initiates proceedings for a bond—whether for keeping the peace or for good behavior—it is based on "information" that must be tested through a formal judicial inquiry. **Section 135** of the BNSS (corresponding to Section 116 of the old CrPC) mandates that the Magistrate must inquire into the truth of the information. If, after this inquiry, the allegations are found to be baseless or incorrect, the law provides a mandatory exit route. The rationale is to uphold "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) by ensuring that the liberty of a person is not curtailed unless there is proven necessity. In the specific case where an allegation of bad character is found incorrect, the Magistrate cannot arbitrarily demand a different kind of security, as each bond requires its own specific legal justification.

**Main Body**

The legal position regarding the scenario where allegations are found incorrect is governed by **Section 137** of the BNSS (corresponding to Section 118 of the old CrPC):

**1\. Mandatory Discharge (Section 137\)**

If, upon the completion of an inquiry under Section 135, it is not proved that it is necessary for keeping the peace or maintaining good behavior that the person should execute a bond, the Magistrate is legally bound to:

* Make an entry on the record to that effect.  
* If the person is in custody only for the purposes of the inquiry, **release him** immediately.  
* If the person is not in custody, **discharge him**.

*Example:* **Kanishth** is reported to be a person of bad character (a habitual offender) in **Patna**. He is arrested and brought before Magistrate **Raghavendra** to show cause why he should not execute a bond for good behavior under **Section 129**. After conducting an inquiry and hearing witnesses like **Prateek** and **Krishna**, **Raghavendra** finds that the allegations against **Kanishth** were based on a personal grudge and are factually incorrect. Under Section 137, **Raghavendra** must discharge **Kanishth** immediately.

**2\. Prohibition on Switching the Bond**

A Magistrate cannot demand a "Bond for Keeping Peace" (Section 126\) if the inquiry was for a "Bond for Good Behavior" (Section 129\) and the allegations failed. Each section has different legal requirements:

* **Section 126 (Peace Bond):** Requires a likelihood of a breach of peace or disturbance of public tranquility.  
* Section 127–129 (Good Behavior Bond): Requires the person to be a suspected person, a habitual offender, or one disseminating seditious matters.  
  If the specific information that led to the inquiry (bad character) is found false, the Magistrate cannot "guess" that the person might still break the peace. A fresh "reason to believe" would be required for a peace bond, supported by fresh information.

**3\. Judicial Application of Mind**

The courts have consistently held that these preventive sections are not to be used to keep "suspected" people in jail indefinitely. If Satyam is falsely accused by Saurabh of being a habitual thief, and the inquiry proves Satyam is a respectable citizen of Indore, the Magistrate Krishna has no jurisdiction to keep him under any bond.

*Example:* If **Kanishth** is cleared of the "bad character" charge, Magistrate **Raghavendra** cannot say, "Since you are already here, sign a peace bond anyway." This would be an illegal exercise of power.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the law is very clear: if the allegations of bad character against a person are found incorrect during a judicial inquiry, the person **cannot** be required to execute a bond for keeping the peace or any other purpose. **Section 137 of the BNSS 2023** acts as a vital check on executive and judicial power, ensuring that once the "information" is proven false, the person's liberty is restored immediately. This prevents individuals like **Kanishth** or **Satyam** from being victimized by the system. For every resident in cities like **Lucknow** or **Patna**, this provision ensures that the preventive powers of the Magistrate are used strictly according to the "procedure established by law," maintaining the delicate balance between public order and individual freedom.

## Q4. Is it discretionary to accept or reject a surety offered by a person for purposes of bond? What legal consequences would follow if there is a default of Security?

**Discretion to Accept or Reject Sureties and Consequences of Default**

**Introduction**

The effectiveness of a "Preventive Bond" depends entirely on the reliability of the "Surety"—the person who guarantees the good behavior of the individual. If a surety is a person of straw or a criminal themselves, the bond becomes a meaningless piece of paper. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the Magistrate is given the power to scrutinize the fitness of a surety under **Section 140** (corresponding to Section 121 of the old CrPC). Furthermore, the law prescribes serious consequences if a person fails to provide the required security. This is governed by **Section 141** (corresponding to Section 122 of the old CrPC). The rationale is to ensure that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is not compromised by unreliable guarantees. The Magistrate's power is not arbitrary; it is a "judicial discretion" that must be exercised through a proper inquiry to balance public safety with individual liberty.

**Main Body**

**1\. Is it Discretionary to Accept or Reject a Surety? (Section 140\)**

Yes, it is discretionary, but it is a regulated discretion. A Magistrate may refuse to accept any surety or reject one previously accepted if they believe the person is "unfit." However, the following procedure must be followed:

* **Mandatory Inquiry:** Before rejecting a surety, the Magistrate must hold an inquiry on oath themselves or ask a subordinate Magistrate to do so and submit a report.  
* **Notice Requirement:** The Magistrate must give reasonable notice to the surety and the person who offered the surety before holding the inquiry.  
* **Basis of Fitness:** Fitness is not just about financial capacity. It also includes the moral character of the surety and their ability to exercise control over the person for whom they are standing guarantee.  
  *Example:* **Kanishth** is ordered to provide a surety for his good behavior in **Lucknow**. His friend **Saurabh** offers to be the surety. Magistrate **Raghavendra** discovers that **Saurabh** himself has multiple pending criminal cases. After holding an inquiry, **Raghavendra** rejects **Saurabh** as an "unfit person" because he cannot be expected to ensure **Kanishth's** good behavior.

**2\. Legal Consequences of Default of Security (Section 141\)**

If a person like Prateek or Kanishth is ordered to give security but fails to do so on or before the date the period commences, the legal consequences are severe:

* **Commitment to Prison:** The person shall be committed to prison until the period expires or until they provide the security to the Court.  
* **Nature of Imprisonment:** \* If the security was for **Keeping the Peace** (Section 125/126), the imprisonment shall be **Simple**.  
  * If the security was for **Good Behavior**, the imprisonment can be **Rigorous or Simple**, as the Court directs.  
* *Example:* **Sachkeerat** is a habitual offender in **Amritsar**. He is ordered to give security for three years but fails to find a surety. Magistrate **Satyam** commits him to **Rigorous Imprisonment** for the duration of the bond period.

**3\. Limitation on Imprisonment**

The period of imprisonment for default cannot exceed the period for which the security was originally demanded. If Laukendra was asked for a one-year bond, he cannot be kept in jail for more than one year for failing to provide it.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the power of a Magistrate to reject a surety under **Section 140 of the BNSS 2023** is a vital "gatekeeping" function. It ensures that only responsible and fit individuals like **Krishna** or **Satyam** stand as guarantees for public peace. While the discretion is broad, the requirement of a mandatory inquiry ensures it is not used unfairly. On the other hand, the consequence of imprisonment under **Section 141** serves as a strong deterrent, emphasizing that the Court’s order for a bond is a serious legal mandate. For the residents of cities like **Lucknow** and **Amritsar**, these provisions ensure that "Nagarik Suraksha" is maintained by holding individuals accountable to the promises made to the State.

---

## Q5. It is entirely within the discretion of the Chief Judicial Magistrate to determine when and under what circumstances he should release persons imprisoned for failing to give security. Discuss.

**Power to Release Persons Imprisoned for Failing to Give Security**

**Introduction**

The preventive justice system in India is designed to maintain order, but it also contains built-in "mercy" provisions to ensure that detention is not unnecessarily prolonged. When a person is imprisoned for failing to provide security for keeping the peace or good behavior, they are not serving a sentence for a crime but are being detained to prevent a potential threat. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the power to release such individuals is governed by **Section 142** (corresponding to Section 123 of the old CrPC). This section grants significant discretionary power to the **Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM)** and the **District Magistrate (DM)**. The rationale is that if the threat to society has diminished or if the detention is no longer required, the head of the district's judiciary or executive should have the authority to restore the person’s liberty. This ensures that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is balanced with the fundamental right to freedom.

**Main Body**

The discretion of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (and the District Magistrate) under Section 142 of the BNSS is broad but is guided by specific legal principles:

**1\. The Ground of "No Hazard" to the Community**

The primary condition for exercising this discretion is the official "opinion" of the Magistrate. Whenever the CJM (in judicial cases) or the DM (in executive cases) is of the opinion that a person imprisoned for failing to give security can be released without hazard to the community or to any other person, they may order their release.

* *Example:* **Kanishth** was imprisoned in **Patna** for failing to provide a bond for good behavior after a neighborhood fight. After three months, Magistrate **Raghavendra** (CJM) reviews the case and finds that the local tension has vanished and **Kanishth’s** family has promised to keep him away from trouble. Finding no "hazard" to the community, **Raghavendra** orders his release.

**2\. Power to Discharge or Reduce Security**

The discretion is not limited to a "yes or no" decision. The CJM or DM has the power to:

* **Discharge** the person entirely.  
* **Reduce the amount** of the security required.  
* **Reduce the number of sureties** or the period of the bond.  
* *Example:* **Satyam** is in jail in **Indore** because he couldn't find two sureties for a bond of ₹50,000. CJM **Krishna** may decide that one surety and a bond of ₹10,000 is sufficient and release him once those new terms are met.

**3\. Conditional vs. Unconditional Release**

The Magistrate may direct the discharge of the person either unconditionally or upon any conditions which the person accepts. If a conditional release is granted, the person must follow those rules (e.g., reporting to a police station every week).

* *Example:* **Sachkeerat** is released from an **Amritsar** jail by CJM **Satyam** on the condition that he does not enter the local market area for six months. If **Sachkeerat** agrees and follows this, he remains free.

**4\. Power to Cancel the Release (The "Check" on Discretion)**

The discretion is not final. If the person violates the conditions of their release, the CJM or DM can cancel the order of discharge. The person can then be arrested without a warrant and sent back to prison for the unexpired portion of the original term.

* *Example:* If **Sachkeerat** is caught in the restricted market area in **Amritsar**, Officer **Saurabh** can arrest him immediately. CJM **Satyam** will then cancel his discharge and send him back to prison.

**5\. Distinguishing DM and CJM Powers**

Under the BNSS, the District Magistrate exercises this power if the original order for security was passed by an Executive Magistrate. The Chief Judicial Magistrate exercises it if the order was passed by any other (Judicial) Court.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the discretion vested in the Chief Judicial Magistrate under **Section 142 of the BNSS 2023** is a critical safety valve in the preventive justice system. It prevents the law from becoming an instrument of indefinite detention for the poor or those who lack social connections to find sureties. By allowing for a "no hazard" assessment, the law ensures that individuals like **Kanishth** or **Satyam** are not kept in jails in **Patna** or **Indore** longer than necessary. While the power is "entirely within the discretion" of the Magistrate, it must be exercised based on the objective reality of public safety. This balance between the State’s power to detain and the Magistrate’s power to release is the essence of a "just, fair, and reasonable" procedure under the Sanhita.

## Q6. Write a short note on Security for an unexpired period of bond.

**Security for an Unexpired Period of Bond**

**Introduction**

The continuity of a preventive bond is essential to ensure that the period of "good behavior" or "keeping the peace" determined by the Court is fully observed. However, circumstances often change during the term of a bond—a surety may die, become insolvent, or simply wish to be relieved of their responsibility. In such cases, the law must ensure that the individual does not remain "unsecured" for the remainder of the term. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the provision for "Security for an unexpired period of bond" is handled through **Sections 140 and 143** (corresponding to Sections 121 and 124 of the old CrPC). The rationale is to maintain "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) by ensuring that a gap in security does not occur, while also respecting the right of a surety to withdraw from a legal obligation.

---

**Main Body**

The procedure for obtaining security for the remaining or unexpired period of a bond arises in three primary situations:

1\. Death or Insolvency of a Surety (Section 140\)

If a surety who guaranteed the behavior of a person like Prateek dies, or if they are declared insolvent by a court, the original bond becomes weak.

* **Procedure:** The Magistrate who took the original bond (e.g., Magistrate **Raghavendra** in **Lucknow**) may order the person (**Prateek**) to furnish fresh security.  
* **The Order:** The person is required to provide a new surety for the "unexpired portion" of the original period.  
* **Default:** If the fresh security is not provided, the Magistrate may deal with the person as if they had defaulted on the original bond order.

2\. Discharge of a Surety (Section 143\)

A surety has the legal right to apply to be relieved of their obligation. If Krishna stands as a surety for Kanishth in Patna, but later feels that Kanishth is becoming difficult to control, she can apply to the Magistrate to be discharged.

* **Summons/Warrant:** On such an application, the Magistrate shall issue a summons or warrant to bring the person (**Kanishth**) before the court.  
* **Cancellation:** Once the person appears, the Magistrate shall cancel the old bond and order the person to provide "fresh security" for the unexpired period.  
* *Example:* Judge **Saurabh** in **Patna** cancels **Krishna’s** bond. He then tells **Kanishth**, "You still have 8 months left on your two-year peace bond. You must find a new surety like **Satyam** for these remaining 8 months."

3\. Rejection of an Existing Surety

Under Section 140, if a Magistrate later discovers that an existing surety is "unfit" (perhaps they have committed a crime), the Magistrate can, after a proper inquiry, order the person to find a new, fit surety for the remaining time.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions for security for an unexpired period under the **BNSS 2023** act as a "maintenance mechanism" for preventive justice. By allowing for the replacement of sureties who are no longer available or suitable, the law ensures that the period of oversight decided by the Court is never cut short prematurely. This protects the community in cities like **Lucknow** and **Patna** from potential risks. For individuals like **Kanishth**, it provides a fair opportunity to continue their liberty by finding a new guarantor like **Satyam** rather than facing immediate imprisonment. Ultimately, these rules uphold the integrity of the bond system and ensure that the State’s promise of "Nagarik Suraksha" is fulfilled for the entire duration originally intended by the Magistrate.

## Q8. Discuss the procedure prescribed for initiating proceedings under Section 144 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.

---

## Q9. When the maintenance allowance awarded under Section 144 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita can be altered?

**When Maintenance Allowance under Section 144 BNSS Can Be Altered**

**Introduction**

A maintenance order passed by a Magistrate is not a final, unchangeable decree. Since the financial status and life situations of individuals are constantly evolving, the law must remain flexible. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, while **Section 144** establishes the right to maintenance for wives, children, and parents, it is **Section 146** (corresponding to Section 127 of the old CrPC) that provides the mechanism for its alteration. The rationale is to ensure that the amount awarded remains fair and realistic over time. If a person’s income increases significantly or if a dependent’s needs grow due to illness or education, the law allows the Magistrate to "alter" the allowance. This ensures "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) by preventing the order from becoming either an insufficient pittance for the receiver or an impossible burden for the payer.

**Main Body**

According to **Section 146 of the BNSS 2023**, a Magistrate of the First Class can alter, vary, or cancel a maintenance order under the following circumstances:

**1\. Proof of Change in Circumstances (Section 146(1))**

This is the most common ground for alteration. If either the person receiving the money or the person paying it can prove a significant change in their life situation, the Magistrate can increase, decrease, or cancel the allowance.

* **Increase in Income/Needs:** If **Prateek** was ordered to pay ₹5,000 to his wife **Krishna** in **Lucknow**, but **Prateek** gets a high-paying promotion in **Mumbai**, **Krishna** can apply to have the amount increased. Similarly, if their child **Satyam** needs expensive medical treatment, the allowance can be hiked.  
* **Decrease in Income:** If **Kanishth**, who was paying maintenance in **Patna**, loses his job or suffers a major business loss, he can apply to Magistrate **Raghavendra** to have the monthly amount reduced.

**2\. Decision of a Competent Civil Court (Section 146(2))**

If a Civil Court passes a decree that affects the status of the parties or their financial rights, the Magistrate must vary or cancel the maintenance order accordingly.

* *Example:* If a Civil Court in **Varanasi** grants a divorce and awards a permanent alimony (lump sum) to **Saurabh’s** ex-wife, the Magistrate may cancel the monthly maintenance order previously passed under Section 144\.

**3\. Remarriage of a Divorced Woman (Section 146(3)(a))**

If a woman who was receiving maintenance after a divorce decides to remarry, the Magistrate shall cancel the maintenance order from the date of her remarriage.

* *Example:* **Krishna** remarries **Laukendra** in **Indore**. Her former husband **Prateek** can apply to Magistrate **Sachkeerat** to stop the maintenance payments immediately.

**4\. Receipt of Customary Dues (Section 146(3)(b))**

If a divorced woman has received the full sum due to her under any customary or personal law (such as Mahr in certain personal laws), the Magistrate shall cancel the order.

* If the sum was paid before the order, the order is cancelled from its start date.  
* If paid after the order, it is cancelled from the date the maintenance period expires.

**5\. Voluntary Surrender of Rights (Section 146(3)(c))**

If a woman, after obtaining a divorce, voluntarily gives up her right to maintenance, the Magistrate shall cancel the order from that date.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions for the alteration of maintenance under **Section 146 of the BNSS 2023** act as a necessary adjustment tool for the judiciary. By allowing the Magistrate to revisit orders based on "change in circumstances" or "civil court decisions," the law keeps pace with the realities of life in cities like **Lucknow**, **Patna**, and **Amritsar**. It ensures that individuals like **Prateek** and **Krishna** are treated with equity—protecting the receiver from destitution while ensuring the payer is not unfairly exploited. This adaptability is the hallmark of a "just and fair" legal system, ensuring that maintenance remains a tool for social welfare rather than a static punishment.

## Q10. How the order of maintenance is enforced under section 147 of BNSS 2013?

**Enforcement of Order of Maintenance under Section 147 of BNSS 2023**

**Introduction**

A judicial order for maintenance is of no value to a person in distress if it cannot be effectively and swiftly enforced. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, recognizes that a person ordered to pay maintenance might try to evade their responsibility by moving to a different city or simply refusing to pay. To counter this, **Section 147** (corresponding to Section 128 of the old CrPC) provides a robust and simplified mechanism for the "Enforcement of order of maintenance." This section acts as the administrative engine that ensures the "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) promised under Section 144 actually reaches the beneficiary. The rationale is to make the maintenance order "portable" across the country, ensuring that a woman, child, or parent does not have to struggle with jurisdictional hurdles to receive their rightful support.

**Main Body**

The enforcement of a maintenance order under Section 147 of the BNSS involves several critical procedural steps designed for the convenience of the person receiving the allowance:

**1\. Providing a Free Copy of the Order**

The first step in enforcement is ensuring that the beneficiary has the legal document required to demand payment. Section 147 mandates that a copy of the order of maintenance (or interim maintenance) and the expenses of the proceedings shall be given without payment to the person in whose favor it is made, or to their guardian.

*Example:* **Krishna** wins a maintenance case against **Prateek** in a court in **Lucknow**. The Magistrate, **Raghavendra**, must ensure that **Krishna** receives a certified copy of the order immediately and for free. This copy is **Krishna's** "legal tool" to seek enforcement anywhere in India.

**2\. Jurisdictional Flexibility (Enforcement Anywhere)**

One of the most powerful features of Section 147 is that the order can be enforced by any Magistrate in any place where the person against whom it is made (the respondent) may be found. The beneficiary does not need to travel back to the original court that passed the order.

*Example:* If **Prateek** moves from **Lucknow** to **Amritsar** to avoid paying **Krishna**, she does not need to keep filing applications in **Lucknow**. She can take her free copy of the order to a Magistrate in **Amritsar**, such as Judge **Saurabh**, and ask him to enforce it.

**3\. The Magistrate’s Satisfaction (Identity and Non-payment)**

Before enforcing the order, the Magistrate in the new jurisdiction must be satisfied regarding two specific points:

* **Identity:** That the parties before the court are indeed the same people mentioned in the order.  
* **Non-payment:** That the allowance (or part of it) has truly not been paid.

*Example:* When **Krishna** approaches Judge **Saurabh** in **Amritsar**, he will verify that the man in front of him is indeed **Prateek** and confirm through records or statements that the monthly allowance of ₹10,000 has been unpaid for three months.

**4\. Linkage with Recovery Mechanisms (Section 144(3))**

While Section 147 provides the authority to enforce, the actual "methods" of recovery are borrowed from Section 144(3) of the BNSS. Once satisfied, the Magistrate can:

* **Issue a Warrant:** A warrant for levying the amount due can be issued in the same manner as a warrant for levying fines. This may include the attachment and sale of the defaulter's property.  
* **Imprisonment:** If the person continues to fail to pay without "sufficient cause," the Magistrate can sentence them to imprisonment for a term which may extend to **one month** for each month's default, or until the payment is made.

*Example:* If **Prateek** still refuses to pay despite having the means, Judge **Saurabh** in **Amritsar** can order the seizure of **Prateek’s** vehicle or sentence him to jail for a month for the default.

**5\. The One-Year Limitation Period**

It is important to note that a warrant for the recovery of unpaid maintenance will not be issued unless an application is made to the Court within one year from the date on which the amount became due. This ensures that the beneficiary, like Krishna, acts promptly and doesn't allow arrears to pile up indefinitely.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, **Section 147 of the BNSS 2023** is a vital provision that breathes life into the maintenance laws of India. By providing free copies of orders and allowing for enforcement across different districts, it eliminates the geographical barriers that often protect defaulters like **Prateek**. It prioritizes the survival and dignity of vulnerable individuals like **Krishna**, **Satyam**, and **Kanishth**, ensuring they are not left destitute by the technicalities of a moving respondent. Whether in **Lucknow**, **Amritsar**, or **Indore**, the power of a Magistrate to enforce these orders ensures that the social welfare goal of the Sanhita is met, upholding the true spirit of "Nagarik Suraksha" and gender justice in the 21st century.

## Q11. Discuss the various provisions under B.N.S.S. which are helpful for the Maintenance of Public order and tranquility.

**Provisions for Maintenance of Public Order and Tranquility under BNSS 2023**

**Introduction**

The primary duty of any government is to maintain "Public Order and Tranquility," which refers to a state of peace and the absence of violence or chaos in society. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, dedicates **Chapter XII (Sections 148 to 167\)** to this objective. Unlike the punitive parts of the code that punish crimes after they occur, these provisions are essentially **preventive** and **remedial**. They provide the Executive and Police with the legal tools to manage crowds, handle unlawful assemblies, remove public nuisances, and resolve urgent threats to public safety. These powers are the backbone of "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), ensuring that life in Indian cities—from **Patna** to **Amritsar**—continues without disruption from riots, public obstructions, or civil unrest.

**Main Body**

The BNSS provides a four-fold structure for maintaining public order:

1\. Management of Assemblies (Sections 148–151)

These sections deal with the dispersal of unlawful assemblies. Any Executive Magistrate or Officer in charge of a police station can command an unlawful assembly to disperse. If they refuse, force can be used.

* **Civil Force (Section 149):** Use of police to disperse crowds.  
* **Armed Forces (Section 150):** If civil force is insufficient, the highest-ranking Executive Magistrate can call for the assistance of the armed forces.

*Example:* In **Lucknow**, a mob led by **Kanishth** blocks a main highway. Magistrate **Raghavendra** commands them to disperse. When they refuse, he authorizes Officer **Saurabh** to use civil force to clear the road.

2\. Public Nuisances (Sections 152–162)

These provisions allow for the removal of obstructions or nuisances that affect the public's right to safety, health, or comfort.

* **Conditional Order (Section 152):** A Magistrate can order the removal of an illegal construction, the fencing of a dangerous tank, or the stopping of a noisy trade.

*Example:* **Satyam** operates a chemical unit in a residential area of **Indore** that emits toxic fumes. Magistrate **Krishna** issues a conditional order under Section 152 to shut down the unit unless **Satyam** can prove it is safe.

3\. Urgent Cases of Nuisance or Apprehended Danger (Section 163\)

This is the most well-known provision (formerly Section 144 CrPC). It allows a Magistrate to issue temporary, immediate orders to prevent riots, injury to human life, or disturbance of tranquility.

* It is used to impose curfews, restrict assemblies, or ban the carrying of weapons.

*Example:* To prevent communal tension during a festival in **Varanasi**, DM **Raghavendra** issues an order under Section 163 prohibiting the assembly of more than five people in sensitive areas.

4\. Disputes as to Immovable Property (Sections 164–167)

Disputes over land or water often lead to violent clashes. The BNSS allows a Magistrate to intervene and decide "possession" (not title) to prevent a breach of peace.

* **Section 164:** If there is a likelihood of a breach of peace concerning land, the Magistrate can call both parties to state their claims.

*Example:* **Prateek** and **Laukendra** have a violent dispute over a farm in **Punjab**. Magistrate **Sachkeerat** takes over the property under Section 164 and orders them to maintain peace until a Civil Court decides the owner.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions for the maintenance of public order and tranquility in the **BNSS 2023** are comprehensive and proactive. By giving Executive Magistrates like **Raghavendra** and **Krishna** the authority to act before a situation spirals out of control, the law prioritizes collective safety over individual actions that disturb the peace. Whether it is managing a chaotic assembly in **Lucknow** or settling a land dispute in **Punjab**, these sections ensure that the administration has the necessary legal backing to uphold the rule of law. They represent the practical application of "Nagarik Suraksha," ensuring that peace is preserved as a prerequisite for a functional and civilized society.

What is Section 163, B.N.S.S., 2023? Discuss its relevance. (2019)

**Temporary Orders in Urgent Cases of Nuisance or Apprehended Danger (Section 163 BNSS)**

**Introduction**

In the legal architecture of India, the power to maintain public order is primarily an executive function. There are situations where a regular judicial trial or even a standard administrative process is too slow to prevent a catastrophe. To address these "flashpoint" moments, the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides an extraordinary preventive power under **Section 163** (which replaces the famous Section 144 of the old CrPC). This section is designed for "urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger." It empowers Executive Magistrates to issue temporary, restrictive orders to prevent riots, health hazards, or threats to human life. The core philosophy behind this provision is that the State must have the ability to act swiftly to protect the collective "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), even if it requires a temporary suspension of certain individual liberties.

**Main Body**

**1\. What is Section 163 of BNSS, 2023?**

Section 163 is a specialized legal tool that allows a Magistrate to issue a written order directing any person to abstain from a certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in their possession. It is applicable when there is an "emergency" or a need for a "speedy remedy."

* **Competent Authorities:** The power is vested in the **District Magistrate (DM)**, a **Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM)**, or any other **Executive Magistrate** specially empowered by the State Government.  
* **The Threshold for Action:** The Magistrate must be satisfied that there is sufficient ground for proceeding and that immediate prevention is desirable to prevent:  
  * Obstruction, annoyance, or injury to any person lawfully employed.  
  * Danger to human life, health, or safety.  
  * A disturbance of public tranquility, or a riot, or an affray.

**2\. Powers of the Magistrate to Issue Temporary Orders**

The Magistrate's power under Section 163 is broad and flexible. The order can be:

* **Prohibitory:** Forbidding the assembly of five or more people, banning the carrying of weapons, or restricting internet services in a sensitive area.  
* **Property-Related:** Directing a property owner to take specific safety measures.  
* **Target Audience:** The order can be directed to a specific individual, to people living in a particular area, or to the public generally when visiting a specific location.

*Example:* In **Varanasi**, a dispute arises between two groups over a religious procession route. DM **Raghavendra** receives intelligence that **Kanishth** and **Saurabh** are planning to lead armed supporters to the site. To prevent a "riot," **Raghavendra** issues an order under Section 163 prohibiting the assembly of more than four people and the carrying of lathis in that specific ward for the next 48 hours.

**3\. Relevance of Section 163 in Modern Governance**

The relevance of Section 163 cannot be overstated. It serves as the first line of defense in several modern scenarios:

* **Public Health Emergencies:** During a pandemic or a toxic leak, a Magistrate can order residents to stay indoors.  
  *Example:* A chemical factory owned by **Satyam** in **Bhopal** develops a leak. SDM **Krishna** uses Section 163 to order the immediate evacuation of the surrounding colony to prevent "danger to human life."  
* **Cyber-Security and Social Media:** It is frequently used to temporarily suspend internet services to prevent the spread of inflammatory rumors that could lead to communal violence.  
* **Large Gatherings:** It helps manage massive crowds during festivals or political rallies to prevent stampedes or "affrays."

**4\. Procedural Safeguards**

While the power is vast, the BNSS imposes limits to prevent abuse. Every order must state the material facts (reasons) in writing. An order is typically valid for two months, though the State Government can extend it up to six months if the danger to life or safety persists. Any person aggrieved, like Prateek or Laukendra, can apply to the Magistrate to rescind or alter the order, and they must be given a hearing.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, **Section 163 of the BNSS 2023** is an indispensable "emergency brake" in the hands of the administration. Its relevance lies in its ability to bridge the gap between peace and chaos. While it is a verbatim successor to the old Section 144 CrPC, its application in the modern context of "Nagarik Suraksha" requires a delicate balance. Magistrates like **Raghavendra** and **Krishna** must ensure that the "speedy remedy" does not become a tool for unnecessary suppression of democratic rights. When used judiciously, as seen in cities like **Bhopal** and **Varanasi**, Section 163 remains a vital instrument for preserving the sanctity of human life and the tranquility of the public square.

## Q15. Can an ex parte order be passed under Section 163 of the Sanhita? If so, how long will it remain in force?

**Ex Parte Orders and Their Duration under Section 163 of BNSS**

**Introduction**

A fundamental principle of natural justice is *audi alteram partem*, which means "hear the other side." Generally, no legal order should be passed against a person without giving them an opportunity to explain their position. However, the law recognizes that in matters of public safety and emergency, "speed" is often more important than "procedure." Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, **Section 163** (formerly Section 144 of the CrPC) provides the Executive Magistrate with extraordinary powers to issue orders to prevent urgent nuisances or apprehended dangers. A crucial feature of this section is the power to pass an "ex parte" order—an order passed in the absence of the person affected. This ensures that in a race against time, "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is not defeated by the technical requirement of serving a notice when a riot, a disaster, or a threat to life is imminent.

**Main Body**

The BNSS provides clear guidelines on when an ex parte order can be issued and how long such restrictions can legally last:

1\. The Power to Pass an Ex Parte Order (Section 163(2))

Yes, an ex parte order can absolutely be passed under Section 163 of the Sanhita. According to Section 163(2), a Magistrate may pass such an order in two specific situations:

* **Cases of Emergency:** When the threat is so sudden that any delay would result in irreparable harm.  
* **Lack of Time for Notice:** When the circumstances do not allow for the serving of a notice in due time upon the person against whom the order is directed.

*Example:* In **Lucknow**, **Raghavendra**, the District Magistrate, receives an urgent intelligence report at midnight. It states that **Kanishth** has gathered a mob and is planning to set fire to a public building in the next hour. Since there is no time to send a legal notice to **Kanishth** and wait for his reply, **Raghavendra** immediately issues an ex parte order under Section 163(2) prohibiting **Kanishth** and his associates from entering that area.

2\. Grounds for Ex Parte Action

The Magistrate must still be satisfied that the order is necessary to prevent:

* Danger to human life, health, or safety.  
* A disturbance of public tranquility, or a riot, or an affray.

*Example:* In **Amritsar**, a toxic gas leak occurs in a warehouse owned by **Sachkeerat**. To prevent "danger to health," Magistrate **Saurabh** passes an ex parte order directing **Sachkeerat** to shut the facility and the residents of the nearby colony, including **Prateek** and **Krishna**, to evacuate, even though **Sachkeerat** was not present to argue his case.

3\. Duration of the Order (Section 163(4))

The law ensures that these "emergency" restrictions do not become permanent. There are strict timelines for how long a Section 163 order remains in force:

* **Initial Period:** An order passed by a Magistrate shall not remain in force for more than **two months** from the date it was made.  
* **Extension by State Government:** If the State Government considers it necessary to prevent danger to human life or to prevent a riot, it can extend the order. This extension can be for a further period, but the total duration of the extension cannot exceed **six months**.

*Example:* If the communal tension in **Varanasi** involving **Laukendra** and **Satyam** persists, the initial order passed by Magistrate **Sachkeerat** will expire in two months. However, the Government of **Uttar Pradesh** can extend it so that the total time does not exceed eight months (2 original \+ 6 extended).

4\. Right to Challenge (Section 163(5) and (6))

Even though an order is passed ex parte, the affected person is not helpless. Any person aggrieved, like Kanishth, can apply to the Magistrate to rescind (cancel) or alter the order. The Magistrate is then legally bound to give that person an opportunity of being heard. If the Magistrate rejects the application, they must record the reasons in writing.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, **Section 163 of the BNSS 2023** strikes a delicate balance between emergency administrative powers and individual rights. By allowing for "ex parte" orders under Section 163(2), the law empowers Magistrates like **Raghavendra** and **Saurabh** to act as immediate protectors of the public in cities like **Lucknow** and **Amritsar**. However, by strictly limiting the duration to an initial two months and a maximum extension of six months, the Sanhita ensures that these powers are not misused for indefinite suppression of liberty. The ability to challenge the order afterward ensures that the "ex parte" nature is only a temporary necessity. Ultimately, these provisions ensure that the State can fulfill its primary goal of "Nagarik Suraksha" without permanently compromising the principles of a fair trial and natural justice.

## Q16. Point out the difference between Sections 152 and 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.

**Difference between Sections 152 and 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)**

**Introduction**

The maintenance of public order involves both the removal of long-term hazards and the prevention of sudden, immediate crises. The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, provides two distinct powers for these purposes: **Section 152** (which corresponds to Section 133 of the old CrPC) and **Section 163** (which corresponds to Section 144 of the old CrPC). While both sections empower Executive Magistrates to intervene in the interest of public safety and health, they differ fundamentally in their "nature of urgency" and "procedural requirements." Section 152 is a restorative power used to remove ongoing public nuisances through a "conditional" process that allows for a hearing. In contrast, Section 163 is an emergency power used to prevent imminent danger through immediate, and often "ex-parte," orders. Understanding this distinction is vital to ensuring that "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) is applied proportionately to the threat at hand.

**Main Body**

The legal distinction between Section 152 and Section 163 of the BNSS can be analyzed through the following points:

**1\. Nature of the Situation (Ongoing Nuisance vs. Urgent Danger)**

* **Section 152** is targeted at **public nuisances** that are already in existence or are inherent in a place. This includes illegal obstructions on public roads, dangerous buildings, or trades that are injurious to health. It aims for a permanent solution to an existing problem.  
  *Example:* **Satyam** operates a tannery in **Kanpur** that releases toxic, foul-smelling effluent into a residential colony. Magistrate **Raghavendra** uses **Section 152** to address this ongoing health hazard.  
* **Section 163** is designed for **urgent emergencies** and **apprehended dangers**. It is used when a riot, an affray, or a sudden threat to life or public tranquility is expected to occur in the immediate future.  
  *Example:* Two rival groups led by **Kanishth** and **Saurabh** are planning a violent protest in **Varanasi** tomorrow. Magistrate **Krishna** uses **Section 163** to prohibit any gathering in that area immediately to prevent the riot.

**2\. Procedural Differences: Conditional vs. Absolute**

* Under **Section 152**, the Magistrate first issues a **"conditional order"**. This is a notice asking the person (e.g., **Satyam**) to either remove the nuisance within a specified time or to appear in court and "show cause" why the order should not be made permanent (absolute). It follows the principle of natural justice by giving the party a chance to be heard before the final decision.  
* Under **Section 163**, the order is **immediate** and does not require a "conditional" stage. If the situation is an emergency, the Magistrate can pass an **ex-parte** order without hearing the person (**Kanishth**) first, as any delay could lead to a catastrophe.

**3\. Character of the Order (Quasi-Judicial vs. Executive)**

* Section 152 has a **quasi-judicial** character. If the person objects to the conditional order, the Magistrate must conduct an inquiry, take evidence, and treat the matter somewhat like a trial before making the order absolute.  
* Section 163 is a purely **executive/administrative** order. While the Magistrate must record the "material facts," the focus is on administrative speed to prevent a crisis rather than resolving a long-term dispute over property or nuisances.

**4\. Duration and Effect**

* An order under **Section 152** is intended to be **permanent**. Once the building is demolished or the obstruction is removed, the matter is resolved for good.  
* An order under **Section 163** is **temporary**. It is valid for only **two months**, though it can be extended by the State Government up to a total of **six months** if the danger persists.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the difference between **Section 152 and Section 163 of the BNSS 2023** lies in the balance between "due process" and "administrative speed." Section 152 is the appropriate tool for resolving long-standing public hazards in cities like **Kanpur**, allowing citizens like **Prateek** and **Krishna** to present their cases. However, Section 163 remains the State's "emergency brake," essential for preventing sudden violence in cities like **Varanasi**. By providing these two distinct paths, the BNSS ensures that the administration can uphold "Nagarik Suraksha" effectively—using Section 152 for restorative justice and Section 163 for preventive peace-keeping.

## Q17. How would a Magistrate deal with a situation when he finds that a dispute relating to a piece of land between the two parties is likely to cause a breach of peace? Discuss with recent case law.

**Handling Land Disputes Likely to Cause Breach of Peace (Section 164 BNSS)**

**Introduction**

Disputes over land and water are among the most common causes of violence and civil unrest in India. While the final determination of "ownership" or "title" is the job of a Civil Court, the immediate priority of the administration is to prevent the dispute from escalating into physical conflict. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this preventive power is governed by **Section 164** (corresponding to Section 145 of the old CrPC). This section allows an Executive Magistrate to intervene when a dispute over immovable property is likely to cause a breach of peace. The rationale is to maintain the "status quo" and decide who was in "actual possession" at the time of the dispute. By doing so, the law ensures "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection) by compelling parties to use legal channels rather than force.

**Main Body**

When an Executive Magistrate finds that a land dispute between two parties is likely to lead to violence, the following procedure is adopted under the BNSS:

**1\. Preliminary Order (Section 164(1))**

If a Magistrate (like a DM or SDM) is satisfied from a police report or other information that a dispute concerning land or water exists and is likely to cause a breach of peace, they must make a written order.

* **Content:** The order states the grounds of satisfaction and requires the parties to attend court and put in written statements of their claims regarding "actual possession."  
* **Example:** **Prateek** and **Kanishth** have a violent confrontation over a plot in **Varanasi**. Magistrate **Raghavendra** receives a report from Officer **Saurabh**. **Raghavendra** issues a preliminary order requiring both to appear and prove who was actually using the land.

**2\. Meaning of "Land or Water" (Section 164(2))**

The law defines this broadly to include buildings, markets, fisheries, crops, or even the rents and profits derived from such property.

* **Example:** If **Krishna** and **Laukendra** are fighting over the collection of rent from a market in **Patna**, Magistrate **Satyam** can intervene under this section.

**3\. The Inquiry into Possession (Section 164(4))**

The Magistrate’s job is not to decide who owns the land, but who was in possession on the date of the preliminary order.

* **Evidence:** The Magistrate hears both sides and receives all evidence produced.  
* **The Two-Month Rule:** If a party was "forcibly and wrongfully dispossessed" within **two months** before the police report, the Magistrate may treat that party as if they were still in possession on the date of the order.  
* **Example:** **Sachkeerat** was forcibly kicked out of his shop by **Satyam** in **Amritsar** on November 1st. On December 1st, the Magistrate issues an order. Since the dispossession was within two months, the Magistrate can restore **Sachkeerat** to possession.

**4\. The Final Order (Section 164(6))**

If the Magistrate decides one party is in possession, they issue an order declaring that party entitled to possession until evicted in due course of law by a Civil Court. They also forbid the other party from disturbing that possession.

**5\. Recent Case Law and Trends**

The Supreme Court in various judgments (and recently reflected in High Court rulings like Baba Baidyanath Medical Trust vs. State of Jharkhand, 2024\) has reiterated that:

* The Magistrate’s order is **temporary** and purely to maintain peace.  
* Once a **Civil Court** is seized of the matter and has passed an order (like an injunction), the Magistrate should generally drop the Section 164 proceedings to avoid conflicting orders.  
* Parallel proceedings are unsustainable if a civil suit for the same property is already effectively handling the dispute.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, **Section 164 of the BNSS 2023** provides a "summary remedy" to prevent blood-shed over land. It serves as a bridge, keeping the peace in cities like **Varanasi** and **Patna** until a Civil Court can provide a final answer on ownership. By focusing solely on "possession" and the "likelihood of a breach of peace," the law ensures that individuals like **Prateek** and **Kanishth** cannot take the law into their own hands. It upholds the principle that "settled possession" cannot be disturbed by force, thereby ensuring that the safety of the community remains paramount over private property claims.

---

## Q18. Explain the power to attachment of disputed property.

**Power to Attachment of Disputed Property (Section 165 BNSS)**

**Introduction**

In complex land disputes, there are times when simply declaring who is in possession (under Section 164\) is not enough to prevent violence. If the situation is so volatile that allowing either party to remain on the property would lead to a riot, or if the Magistrate simply cannot figure out who was in possession, the law provides a more drastic "emergency" measure. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, this power is contained in **Section 165** (corresponding to Section 146 of the old CrPC). "Attachment" means the Court takes the property into its own legal custody (*custodia legis*). The rationale is to "freeze" the dispute and remove the immediate cause of conflict from the hands of the warring parties. This is a crucial tool for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), ensuring that a piece of land does not become a battleground in cities like **Patna** or **Lucknow**.

**Main Body**

According to **Section 165 of the BNSS 2023**, a Magistrate can order the attachment of the disputed property under three specific circumstances:

**1\. Grounds for Attachment**

The Magistrate may attach the property at any time after making the preliminary order under Section 164(1) if:

* **Emergency:** The Magistrate considers the case to be one of emergency where immediate action is needed to prevent blood-shed.  
* **None in Possession:** The Magistrate decides that none of the parties was in actual possession at the relevant time.  
* **Inability to Decide:** The Magistrate is unable to satisfy themselves as to which of the parties was in possession.

*Example:* **Raghavendra** and **Kanishth** are fighting over a vacant plot in **Lucknow**. Magistrate **Saurabh** finds that both parties are bringing armed supporters to the site every day (Emergency). Furthermore, neither has built anything or used the land for years (Inability to decide possession). **Saurabh** orders the property to be "attached" and locked.

**2\. Appointment of a Receiver (Section 165(2))**

When a property is attached, it cannot be left neglected. The Magistrate may make arrangements for looking after the property or appoint a Receiver.

* **Who is a Receiver?** A Receiver is an officer of the Court who manages the property, collects rent, or looks after crops. Under the BNSS, a Receiver has all the powers of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\.  
* \**Example:* If the dispute is over an orchard in **Amritsar**, Magistrate **Satyam** appoints **Prateek** (a neutral official) as the Receiver. **Prateek** will ensure the fruits are harvested and sold, and the money is kept safely in the Court's account until the case is over.

**3\. Interaction with Civil Courts**

The BNSS ensures there is no conflict between Criminal and Civil jurisdictions:

* If a **Civil Court** has already appointed a receiver, the Magistrate cannot appoint another one.  
* If the Magistrate has appointed a receiver and a Civil Court later appoints one, the Magistrate's receiver must hand over the property and be discharged.

*Example:* While **Prateek** is managing the orchard in **Amritsar**, a Civil Court in **Punjab** appoints **Krishna** as the official receiver in a title suit. **Prateek** must hand over all records and possession to **Krishna** immediately.

**4\. Withdrawal of Attachment**

The attachment is not permanent. The Magistrate may withdraw it at any time if they are satisfied that there is no longer any likelihood of a breach of the peace.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the power to attach property under **Section 165 of the BNSS 2023** is a powerful administrative "reset button." It effectively removes the bone of contention from the disputing parties, such as **Raghavendra** and **Kanishth**, and places it under the neutral protection of the law. By allowing for the appointment of a Receiver, the Sanhita ensures that the property's value is preserved while the parties settle their rights in a Civil Court. This provision is the ultimate safeguard in the maintenance of public order, ensuring that land disputes in cities like **Lucknow** and **Amritsar** are resolved through evidence and logic rather than sticks and stones, upholding the true spirit of "Nagarik Suraksha."

## Q19. Discuss the powers of a Magistrate for the purpose of maintenance of public order and tranquility.

**Powers of a Magistrate for Maintenance of Public Order and Tranquility**

**Introduction**

The maintenance of public order and tranquility is the cornerstone of a stable society. It ensures that citizens can live their lives without fear of violence, obstruction, or chaos. In India, the responsibility for preserving this peace is primarily entrusted to Executive Magistrates. Under the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, the powers of Magistrates are spread across **Chapter XII (Sections 148 to 167\)**. These powers are preventive in nature, meaning they are designed to stop a disturbance before it begins or to de-escalate a situation before it turns into a disaster. The BNSS provides a graduated set of powers, ranging from the command to disperse a small crowd to the imposition of district-wide restrictions in times of crisis. These tools are essential for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), allowing the administration to safeguard human life, health, and property across Indian cities.

**Main Body**

The powers of a Magistrate for maintaining public order can be categorized into four distinct functional areas under the BNSS:

**1\. Power to Disperse Unlawful Assemblies (Sections 148–151)**

When a group of people gathers in a way that threatens the peace, the Magistrate has the power to intervene.

* **Civil Force (Section 148):** Any Executive Magistrate (like a DM or SDM) can command an unlawful assembly to disperse. If they refuse, the Magistrate can use the police (civil force) to disperse them and arrest those involved.  
* **Use of Armed Forces (Section 149):** If civil force is not enough to disperse the crowd and protect public security, the highest-ranking Executive Magistrate present can call for the help of the Armed Forces.

*Example:* In **Varanasi**, a large mob led by **Kanishth** blocks a critical intersection, threatening to burn public buses. District Magistrate **Raghavendra** arrives and commands the assembly to disperse. When **Kanishth** refuses, **Raghavendra** authorizes Officer **Saurabh** to use civil force to clear the area and restore order.

**2\. Power to Remove Public Nuisances (Sections 152–162)**

This power is used to remove long-term hazards that affect the public's safety, health, or convenience.

* **Conditional Orders (Section 152):** A Magistrate can issue a "conditional order" to stop a dangerous trade, remove an obstruction from a public road, or repair a building that is about to collapse.  
* **Procedure:** The person is given a chance to "show cause" before the order is made absolute.

*Example:* **Satyam** operates a noisy and polluting factory in a residential pocket of **Indore**. The fumes are making the neighbors, including **Krishna** and **Prateek**, sick. Magistrate **Krishna** issues a conditional order under Section 152, requiring **Satyam** to either install filters within 15 days or shut down the factory.

**3\. Power in Urgent Cases of Apprehended Danger (Section 163\)**

Commonly known as the "emergency brake," this section allows for immediate, temporary orders to prevent riots or injury.

* **Scope:** A Magistrate can prohibit people from carrying weapons, assembling in groups, or even using the internet in sensitive zones for a period of up to **two months**.  
* **Ex-Parte:** If the situation is a dire emergency, the Magistrate can pass the order without hearing the other side first.

*Example:* In **Amritsar**, tensions rise between two local groups. To prevent a "riot," Magistrate **Saurabh** issues a Section 163 order prohibiting the assembly of more than five people in the town square. **Sachkeerat** and **Laukendra**, who were planning a protest, must now follow this order or face arrest.

**4\. Power to Resolve Land and Water Disputes (Sections 164–167)**

Disputes over property often lead to physical fights. The Magistrate has the power to intervene to decide who was in "possession" (not the owner) to stop the violence.

* **Attachment (Section 165):** If the dispute is too violent or the Magistrate cannot decide who is in possession, they can "attach" (seize) the property until a Civil Court decides the matter.

*Example:* **Prateek** and **Kanishth** are fighting over a farm in **Patna**. After a violent clash, Magistrate **Sachkeerat** attaches the land under Section 165 and appoints a Receiver to manage the crops, ensuring neither party uses force to take control.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the powers vested in Magistrates under the **BNSS 2023** are vital for the survival of the rule of law. By providing clear mechanisms for dispersing assemblies, removing nuisances, and handling land disputes, the Sanhita ensures that the State can act decisively in the interest of the community. These powers allow officials like **Raghavendra**, **Krishna**, and **Saurabh** to protect citizens in cities like **Varanasi**, **Indore**, and **Amritsar** from both sudden violence and long-term hazards. While these powers are extensive, they are subject to judicial review and time limits, ensuring that "Nagarik Suraksha" is maintained without violating the fundamental principles of justice and liberty.

## Q20. Write short notes on the following:

(a) Critically examine the provisions relating to medical examination of rape accused and victim under B.N.S.S.

(b) Distinguish between ‘Judicial custody’ and ‘police custody.’

**Medical Examination and Custody under BNSS 2023**

**Introduction**

The **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, introduces pivotal reforms to ensure a more efficient, transparent, and victim-centric criminal justice system. Two of its most critical components are the provisions for the medical examination of rape victims and the accused, and the reconfiguration of the rules regarding police and judicial custody. The provisions for medical examination under **Sections 184 and 52** emphasize the dignity of the victim and the scientific collection of evidence, such as DNA profiling, while establishing strict timelines for reporting. Simultaneously, the distinction between **Police Custody** and **Judicial Custody** under **Section 187** remains a fundamental safeguard of personal liberty. These legal structures are essential for "Nagarik Suraksha" (citizen protection), ensuring that in cities from **Lucknow** to **Patna**, the powers of investigation are balanced against the rights of the individual.

---

**Main Body**

**(a) Medical Examination of Rape Accused and Victim (Sections 52 and 184\)**

The BNSS 2023 has strengthened the forensic and procedural requirements for sexual assault cases to prevent the loss of evidence and ensure accountability.

* **Medical Examination of the Victim (Section 184):** When an offence of rape is under investigation, the victim must be examined by a registered medical practitioner.  
  * **24-Hour Rule:** The victim must be sent for examination within **24 hours** from the time the information is received.  
  * **Consent:** No examination can be conducted without the written consent of the woman or a person competent to give consent on her behalf.  
  * **7-Day Reporting Timeline:** A new mandate under the BNSS requires the medical practitioner to forward the report to the Investigating Officer within **seven days**.  
  * *Example:* In **Lucknow**, **Krishna** reports an assault. Officer **Saurabh** ensures she is taken to a government hospital within 24 hours. The doctor, **Raghavendra**, conducts the DNA profiling and records injuries, ensuring **Krishna's** dignity is maintained. The report is submitted to the court within a week.  
* **Medical Examination of the Accused (Section 52):** When a person is arrested for rape, and there are reasonable grounds to believe that an examination will afford evidence (like DNA or marks of struggle), they must be examined by a medical practitioner at a government hospital.  
  * *Example:* **Kanishth** is arrested in **Patna**. To collect forensic evidence, Magistrate **Satyam** orders his medical examination under Section 52\.

**(b) Distinguishing between ‘Judicial Custody’ and ‘Police Custody’ (Section 187\)**

The primary difference lies in the **physical control** over the accused and the **purpose** of the detention.

| Feature | Police Custody | Judicial Custody |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Location** | The accused is kept in a **police station lock-up**. | The accused is kept in a **central or district jail**. |
| **Control** | Under the direct control of the **Police Officer** for investigation. | Under the control of the **Magistrate** and jail authorities. |
| **Purpose** | Primarily for **interrogation** and recovery of evidence. | To prevent the accused from tampering with evidence or fleeing. |
| **Interrogation** | Police have ready access for questioning. | Police require **permission from the Court** to interrogate the accused. |
| **BNSS Reform** | 15 days of police custody can be granted in **parts** during the initial 40/60 days. | Can extend up to **60 or 90 days** depending on the severity of the crime. |

*   
  *Example:* **Prateek** is arrested in **Amritsar** for a crime. Magistrate **Sachkeerat** first sends him to **Police Custody** under Officer **Laukendra** for 10 days to recover stolen items. Later, **Prateek** is moved to **Judicial Custody** in the central jail, where he remains under the supervision of the court until bail or trial.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provisions of the **BNSS 2023** regarding medical examinations and custody illustrate the Sanhita's commitment to scientific investigation and human rights. By mandating a seven-day window for medical reports under Section 184, the law ensures that forensic evidence is integrated into the chargesheet without delay, aiding victims like **Krishna** in their pursuit of justice. Similarly, the clear distinction between police and judicial custody under Section 187 ensures that investigators like **Laukendra** have the necessary time to work, while suspects like **Prateek** are protected from prolonged police interference through judicial oversight. Together, these provisions form a robust framework for "Nagarik Suraksha," ensuring that the Indian criminal justice system in cities like **Lucknow** and **Patna** remains both efficient and humane.
