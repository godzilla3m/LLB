## Q1. What do you understand by a Company? Differentiate between Company and Partnership firm?

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer written in simple sentences, with relatable Indian names and places as *example*s.

---

**Meaning of a Company**

A **company** is a legal entity created under law. It is formed by a group of people who come together to carry on business. A company has a separate legal personality. This means it is different from the people who own it. It can own property, enter into contracts, and sue or be sued in its own name.

> For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** register a company in Lucknow, the company itself becomes a separate person in the eyes of law. Even if Prateek leaves, the company continues to exist.

A company is usually formed under the **Companies Act, 2013** in India. It can be a private company or a public company.

**Key Features of a Company**

* **Separate legal entity**: The company is different from its members.  
* **Limited liability**: Members are liable only up to the amount they invested.  
* **Perpetual succession**: The company continues even if members change or die.  
* **Transferability of shares**: In public companies, shares can be transferred easily.  
* **Regulation by law**: Companies must follow strict rules under the Companies Act.

---

**Meaning of a Partnership Firm**

A **partnership firm** is formed when two or more people agree to carry on business together and share profits. It is governed by the **Indian Partnership Act, 1932**.

Unlike a company, a partnership firm does not have a separate legal personality. The partners themselves are the business.

For *example*, if **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, and **Saurabh** start a cloth shop in Varanasi as partners, the firm is not separate from them. If the firm takes a loan, the partners are personally responsible for repayment.

**Key Features of a Partnership Firm**

* **No separate legal entity**: The firm and partners are the same in law.  
* **Unlimited liability**: Partners are personally responsible for debts.  
* **Mutual agency**: Each partner can bind the firm by his actions.  
* **Limited life**: If a partner dies or leaves, the firm usually dissolves.  
* **Less regulation**: Partnership firms are easier to form and run compared to companies.

---

**Difference Between Company and Partnership Firm**

| Basis | Company | Partnership Firm |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Legal status** | Separate legal entity | Not separate from partners |
| **Liability** | Limited liability of members | Unlimited liability of partners |
| **Formation** | Registered under Companies Act | Formed by agreement under Partnership Act |
| **Continuity** | Perpetual succession | Ends if partner dies or leaves |
| **Ownership transfer** | Shares can be transferred easily | Transfer needs consent of all partners |
| **Management** | Managed by directors | Managed directly by partners |
| **Regulation** | Strict legal compliance | Less legal formalities |

---

**Simple *Example*s for Better Understanding**

* Suppose **Satyam** and **Sachkeerat** start a partnership firm in Patna to sell books. If the firm suffers a loss, both are personally responsible. Their personal property can be used to pay debts.  
* On the other hand, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** start a company in Delhi to run a software business, their liability is limited. If the company suffers a loss, only the company’s assets are used. Their personal houses or cars are safe.

---

**Conclusion**

A company and a partnership firm are two different forms of business organization. A company is a separate legal entity with limited liability and perpetual succession. A partnership firm is not separate from its partners, and partners have unlimited liability.

In simple words, a company is safer for members because their personal property is protected, but it requires more legal compliance. A partnership firm is easier to start and manage, but partners carry higher risk.

Thus, the choice between a company and a partnership depends on the nature of business, the number of people involved, and the level of risk they are willing to take.

## Q2. What do you mean by doctrine of 'ultra-vires'? Discuss the consequences of ultra-vires acts of the company.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer written in simple sentences, with relatable Indian names and places as *example*s.

---

**Doctrine of Ultra Vires (शक्तियों से परे)**

The word *ultra vires* is a Latin term. It means "beyond powers / शक्तियों से परे." In company law, the doctrine of ultra vires says that a company cannot do anything beyond the powers given to it by its Memorandum of Association. The Memorandum of Association is the basic document of a company. It defines the objectives and scope of the company.

If a company does something outside its objects, that act is called ultra vires. Such an act is void (invalid) and cannot be ratified even if all shareholders agree.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a company in Delhi to run a textile business, the company can only do activities related to textiles. If the company suddenly starts a hotel business in Jaipur, that act is ultra vires because it is beyond the objects written in the Memorandum.

---

**Purpose of the Doctrine**

The doctrine protects shareholders and creditors. It ensures that the company uses its funds only for the purposes for which it was created. It prevents misuse of money and protects outsiders dealing with the company.

---

**Consequences of Ultra Vires Acts**

1. **Void nature of the act**  
    Ultra vires acts are void. They cannot be enforced in a court of law. Even if all members agree, the act cannot be made valid.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** are directors of a company in Varanasi and they invest company money in a cinema hall, but the Memorandum allows only trading in electronics, the investment is void.  
2. **Injunction by shareholders**  
    Shareholders can stop the company from doing ultra vires acts by filing an injunction in court.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** and **Satyam**, who are shareholders in a textile company in Patna, see that directors are planning to use funds for a hotel business outside the objects, they can approach the court to stop it.  
3. **Personal liability of directors**  
    Directors may be personally liable if they authorize ultra vires acts. They are supposed to act within the powers of the company.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** is a director of a company in Lucknow and he signs a contract for mining business when the company is only allowed to run a school, he may be personally responsible for losses.  
4. **Company’s property protection**  
   If company property is obtained through an ultra vires act (an act beyond the company’s objects), the company has the right to recover that property.  
   **Simple *Example*:**  
   **Prateek** and **Krishna** use the company’s money to buy land in Kanpur for farming. Farming is not mentioned in the company’s objects. This act is ultra vires.  
   Therefore, the company can take back that land, because the money used belonged to the company and was misused.  
5. **Contracts are unenforceable**  
    Any contract made under ultra vires is unenforceable. Outsiders cannot enforce such contracts against the company.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** signs a contract with a supplier in Bhopal for a hotel project, but the company’s object is only textile trading, the supplier cannot enforce the contract against the company.  
6. **Protection of creditors**  
    Creditors are protected because the company cannot use funds for purposes outside its objects. This ensures that money is not wasted.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** lends money to a company in Allahabad for textile trading, he is safe because the company cannot use that money for unrelated businesses like cinema halls.

*Here’s a simple list of ***example*s of creditors**:*

* ***Banks** (like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank)*  
* ***Suppliers** (who provide goods on credit)*  
* ***Friends or relatives** (who lend money personally)*  
* ***Service providers** (like transport companies, electricity boards)*  
* ***Government** (for unpaid taxes such as GST or income tax)*  
* ***Employees** (for unpaid salaries or wages)*

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company is formed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** in Delhi to manufacture clothes. The Memorandum clearly states "textile manufacturing." Later, directors **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** decide to open a hotel in Jaipur with company funds. This act is ultra vires. Shareholders like **Saurabh** and **Satyam** can stop it. If **Sachkeerat** signs a contract with a hotel supplier, the contract is void. The company cannot be forced to pay.

---

**Conclusion**

The doctrine of ultra vires is an important principle in company law. It ensures that a company acts only within the powers given by its Memorandum of Association. Ultra vires acts are void and cannot be ratified. They may lead to personal liability of directors, injunctions by shareholders, and unenforceable contracts.

In simple words, the doctrine protects shareholders, creditors, and the public from misuse of company funds. It keeps the company within its legal boundaries. For students and business people, the lesson is clear: always check the objects of the company before making decisions.

---

## Q3. Explain the meaning and importance of 'Prospectus'. Discuss the liability of persons issuing a prospectus containing false statements.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Meaning of Prospectus**

A prospectus is a legal document issued by a company when it wants to invite the public to buy its shares or debentures. It contains details about the company, its objectives, financial position, and the terms of issue of shares.

**In simple words**, a prospectus is like an advertisement but with legal value. It tells the public why they should invest in the company and what benefits they may get.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a company in Delhi and want to raise money from the public, they must issue a prospectus. The prospectus will explain the company’s textile business, its profits, and how many shares are available.

---

**Importance of Prospectus**

1. **Information to investors**  
    A prospectus gives important information to investors so they can decide whether to invest.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Varanasi wants to buy shares of a company, he will read the prospectus to understand the business.  
2. **Transparency**  
    It ensures transparency because the company must disclose all material facts.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** is thinking of investing in a company in Lucknow, he can trust the prospectus to give him clear details.  
3. **Legal safeguard**  
    The prospectus protects investors because false statements can lead to liability.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** invests in a company in Patna based on a false prospectus, he can take legal action against the company.  
4. **Public confidence**  
    A prospectus builds confidence among the public. People are more willing to invest when they see official documents.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam** and **Sachkeerat** see a prospectus of a company in Allahabad, they may feel secure in investing.

---

**Liability for False Statements in Prospectus**

If a prospectus contains false statements, the persons who issued it can be held liable. Liability can be civil or criminal.

1. **Civil liability**

   * If an investor suffers loss because of false statements, he can claim **compensation**.  
   * Directors, promoters, and others who authorized the issue of the prospectus are responsible.  
      *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** issue a prospectus in Delhi saying the company made huge profits, but in reality it made losses, investors like **Kanishth** can **sue them** for compensation.  
2. **Criminal liability**

   * If false statements are made knowingly, it is a criminal offence.  
   * The persons responsible may face fines or imprisonment.  
      *Example*: If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** deliberately hide debts of the company in Varanasi and issue a prospectus showing only profits, they can be punished under law.  
3. **Liability of directors and promoters**

   * Directors and promoters must ensure that the prospectus is truthful.  
   * If they fail, they are **personally liable**.  
      *Example*: If **Saurabh** and **Satyam** are directors of a company in Patna and allow a false prospectus to be issued, they are personally responsible.  
4. **Investor’s right to rescind (cancel) contract**

   * If an investor buys shares based on false statements, he can **cancel** the contract.  
      *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** buys shares of a company in Lucknow after reading a false prospectus, he can return the shares and get his money back.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company is formed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** in Delhi to run a textile business. They issue a prospectus claiming that the company has earned ₹10 crore profit. In reality, the company has suffered losses. Investors like **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** buy shares based on this false information. Later, when the truth comes out, the investors can sue the directors for compensation. The directors may also face criminal charges for cheating.

---

**Conclusion**

A prospectus is an important document in company law. It informs the public about the company and helps them decide whether to invest. It ensures transparency and builds trust. However, if a prospectus contains false statements, the persons who issued it are liable both civilly and criminally.

In simple words, the prospectus is the foundation of public investment. Honesty in the prospectus protects investors and strengthens the company. Falsehood in the prospectus harms investors and brings punishment to those responsible.

## Q4. "Majority will have its way but minority must be allowed to have it say." Discuss the concept of prevention of opperssion and mismanagement in context of relevant cases ?
Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Meaning of the Principle**

The phrase "Majority will have its way but minority must be allowed to have its say" reflects the balance in company law. In a company, decisions are usually taken by majority shareholders. However, the law also protects minority shareholders from oppression and mismanagement.

Oppression means unfair treatment of minority shareholders by the majority. Mismanagement means running the company in a way that harms shareholders or the public interest.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** hold majority shares in a company in Delhi, they can decide policies. But if they **misuse** their power to harm minority shareholders like **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra**, the law steps in to protect the minority.

*Example* of **misuse**: pass a resolution to issue new shares only to themselves at a very low price, thereby reducing the ownership percentage of minority shareholders like Raghavendra and Laukendra

---

**Concept of Prevention of Oppression and Mismanagement**

The Companies Act, 2013 in India provides remedies to minority shareholders. **Sections 241 to 246** deal with oppression and mismanagement. Minority shareholders can approach the National Company Law Tribunal (**NCLT**) if they feel oppressed or if the company is mismanaged.

The aim is to ensure **fairness**. Majority shareholders cannot misuse their power to harm minority interests.

---

***Example*s of Oppression**

1. **Unfair removal of minority shareholders**  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** and **Satyam** are minority shareholders in a company in Patna, and majority shareholders force them out without reason, it is oppression.  
2. **Refusal to declare dividends**  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** holds minority shares in a company in Lucknow, and majority shareholders refuse to declare dividends even when profits exist, it is oppression.  
3. **Issue of shares to dilute minority**  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** issue new shares in Delhi only to themselves to reduce **Kanishth’s** shareholding, it is oppression.

**Tip:** minority shareholders are the owners of fewer shares in a company. They may still attend meetings, vote, and receive dividends, but they cannot control the company’s policies alone.

---

***Example*s of Mismanagement**

1. **Misuse of company funds**  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** use company money in Varanasi for personal purposes, it is mismanagement.  
2. **Failure to maintain proper accounts**  
    *Example*: If directors like **Saurabh** and **Satyam** in Patna do not keep records, creditors and shareholders suffer.  
3. **Risky investments without approval**  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** invests company money in Lucknow in a gambling business, it is mismanagement.

---

**Relevant Cases**

1. **Shanti Prasad Jain v. Kalinga Tubes Ltd. (1965)**  
    In this case, minority shareholders alleged oppression. The Supreme Court held that oppression must be continuous and burdensome. Occasional acts are not enough.  
2. **Needle Industries (India) Ltd. v. Needle Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd. (1981)**  
    In this case, issue of shares to dilute minority was challenged. The Court protected minority shareholders and emphasized fairness.  
3. **Sangramsinh P. Gaekwad v. Shantadevi P. Gaekwad (2005)**  
    The Court explained that not every dispute is oppression. Only acts that are harsh and unfair to minority count.

---

**Remedies Available**

* Minority shareholders can apply to NCLT under Section 241\.  
* NCLT can order changes in management.  
* NCLT can cancel unfair decisions.  
* NCLT can regulate conduct of company affairs.  
* In extreme cases, NCLT can order winding up of the company.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company is formed in Delhi by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. Minority shareholders are **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat**. The majority decides not to declare dividends even though profits exist. They also issue new shares only to themselves to reduce minority power. This is oppression. If they also misuse company funds for personal travel to Jaipur, it is mismanagement. Minority shareholders can approach NCLT for relief.

---

**Conclusion**

The principle "Majority will have its way but minority must be allowed to have its say" ensures balance in company law. Majority shareholders can control decisions, but they cannot misuse power. Minority shareholders are protected against oppression and mismanagement through legal remedies.

In simple words, company law gives majority the right to rule but ensures minority is not crushed. This balance maintains fairness, protects investors, and strengthens trust in corporate governance.

---

## Q5. What do you mean by borrowing power of the company? What remedies are open to a lender, if a company resort to ultra-vires borrowing?

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Borrowing Power of the Company**

Borrowing power means the authority of a company to raise money by taking loans or issuing debentures. A company may need funds for expansion, working capital, or new projects. The power to borrow is given by the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association.

*(**Debenture** means a type of loan taken by a company from the public.)*

In simple words, borrowing power allows a company to take money from outsiders with a promise to repay.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a textile company in Delhi, they may borrow money from a bank in Lucknow to buy new machines. This borrowing is valid if it is within the company’s powers.

---

**Types of Borrowing**

1. **Borrowing with security**  
    The company gives security like land, building, or machinery.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** lends money to a company in Varanasi and takes the company’s warehouse as security, it is secured borrowing.  
2. **Borrowing without security**  
    The company borrows without giving any property as security.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** lends ₹10 lakh to a company in Patna without any security, it is unsecured borrowing.  
3. **Borrowing by issue of debentures**  
    The company issues debentures to raise funds.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** buys debentures of a company in Allahabad, he becomes a creditor.

---

**Ultra Vires Borrowing**

Ultra vires borrowing means borrowing beyond the powers of the company. If the Memorandum does not allow borrowing, or if borrowing is beyond the limit, it is ultra vires. Such borrowing is void and cannot be enforced against the company.

For *example*, if **Satyam** and **Sachkeerat** are directors of a company in Lucknow and they borrow money for a hotel business, but the company’s object is only textile trading, the borrowing is ultra vires.

---

**Remedies Open to a Lender in Case of Ultra Vires Borrowing**

1. **Injunction to stop borrowing**  
    A lender can stop the company from using borrowed money for ultra vires purposes.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** lends money to a company in Delhi and sees that directors are using it for gambling, he can approach the court for injunction.  
2. **Right against directors**  
    Directors may be personally liable if they authorize ultra vires borrowing.  
    *Example*: If **Krishna** and **Kanishth** borrow money in Jaipur for purposes outside the Memorandum, the lender can sue them personally.  
3. **Tracing of money**  
    If the borrowed money is still with the company, the lender can recover it.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** lends money to a company in Varanasi and the money is unused in the company’s bank account, he can claim it back.  
4. **Recovery of property**  
    If the borrowed money is used to buy property, the lender can claim rights over that property.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra’s** loan is used to buy land in Patna, he can recover his money by claiming interest in that land.  
5. **Restitution (return) under equity**  
    If the company has benefited from the money, the lender can demand restitution.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** lends money to a company in Allahabad and the company uses it to pay off debts, he can claim repayment (return / refund) under equity.  
6. **No right against company for ultra vires borrowing**  
    The lender cannot enforce the loan against the company because the act is void.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam** lends money to a company in Lucknow for hotel business outside its objects, he cannot sue the company directly.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi is formed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** for textile trading. They borrow ₹50 lakh from **Raghavendra** in Varanasi to start a cinema hall. This borrowing is ultra vires because the company’s object is textile trading. **Raghavendra** cannot enforce the loan against the company. However, he can sue the directors personally, recover money if it is unused, or claim rights over property purchased with his money.

---

**Conclusion**

Borrowing power of a company means its authority to raise funds through loans or debentures. It is valid only if allowed by the Memorandum and Articles. Ultra vires borrowing is void and cannot bind the company. However, the lender has remedies like injunction, suing directors personally, tracing money, or claiming property.

**In simple words,** borrowing power is necessary for business growth, but it must stay within legal limits. Ultra vires borrowing protects shareholders and creditors, while remedies ensure that lenders are not left helpless.

---

## Q6. What do you mean by floating charge? How does it differ from a fixed charge? When does a floating charge become fixed charge?

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Meaning of Floating Charge**

A floating charge is a type of security given by a company to a lender over its assets. It is called "floating" because it is not attached to any specific asset at the time of creation. Instead, it covers a class of assets that keeps changing in the ordinary course of business, such as stock, raw materials, or receivables.

In simple words, a floating charge moves with the assets. The company can use, sell, or replace those assets until the charge becomes fixed.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** run a textile company in Delhi and borrow money from a bank in Lucknow, they may give a floating charge over their stock of cloth. The stock keeps changing every day, but the charge continues to cover whatever stock exists.

---

**Meaning of Fixed Charge**

A fixed charge is a security that is attached to a specific asset of the company. The company cannot sell or dispose of that asset without the lender’s permission.

In simple words, a fixed charge is tied to one particular property.

For *example*, if **Raghavendra** lends money to a company in Varanasi and takes the company’s factory building as security, that is a fixed charge. The company cannot sell the building without his consent.

---

**Difference Between Floating Charge and Fixed Charge**

1. **Nature of asset**

   * Floating charge covers assets that change, like stock or receivables.  
   * Fixed charge covers specific assets like land, building, or machinery.  
2. **Control over asset**

   * Under floating charge, the company can freely use or sell the assets until the charge crystallizes.  
   * Under fixed charge, the company cannot deal with the asset without lender’s permission.  
3. **Flexibility**

   * Floating charge gives flexibility to the company to run its business smoothly.  
   * Fixed charge restricts the company because the asset is locked.  
4. **Security for lender**

   * Floating charge is weaker security because assets keep changing.  
   * Fixed charge is stronger security because it is tied to a permanent asset.

***Example* for clarity:**

* If **Laukendra** lends money to a company in Patna and takes a floating charge over its stock of books, the company can keep selling books in the market.  
* If **Saurabh** lends money to a company in Allahabad and takes a fixed charge over its warehouse, the company cannot sell the warehouse without his approval.

---

**When Does a Floating Charge Become a Fixed Charge?**

A floating charge becomes fixed when it "crystallizes i.e. becomes solid or fixed." Crystallization means the charge attaches to specific assets. This happens in certain situations:

1. **Company goes into liquidation**  
    *Example*: If **Satyam’s** textile company in Lucknow is wound up, the floating charge over its stock becomes fixed on whatever stock exists at that time. Meaning, the **leftover cloths in the warehouse become the fixed charge**. The lender can claim rights over those cloths to recover their money.  
2. **Company stops business**  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat’s** company in Kanpur stops trading, the floating charge over its raw materials becomes fixed on whatever raw materials remain.  
3. **Company defaults on loan**  
    *Example*: If **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth’s** company in Delhi fails to repay the bank loan, the floating charge over its cloth stock crystallizes and becomes fixed.  
4. **Condition in the agreement**  
    Sometimes the loan agreement itself says that on certain events, the floating charge will become fixed.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** lends money to a company in Varanasi and the agreement states that if profits fall below a certain level, the floating charge will become fixed, then it crystallizes when that condition occurs.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a textile company in Delhi is run by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. They borrow ₹50 lakh from a bank in Lucknow. The bank takes a floating charge over the company’s stock of cloth. The company continues to buy and sell cloth every day. Later, the company fails to repay the loan. At that moment, the floating charge crystallizes and becomes fixed on whatever cloth stock is present in the warehouse.

On the other hand, if **Raghavendra** lends money to a company in Varanasi and takes the company’s factory building as security, that is a fixed charge from the beginning. The company cannot sell the building without his consent.

---

**Conclusion**

A floating charge is a security over assets that keep changing, while a fixed charge is tied to a specific asset. Floating charge gives flexibility to the company but is weaker for the lender. Fixed charge is stronger but restricts the company. A floating charge becomes fixed when it crystallizes, such as during liquidation, default, or stoppage of business.

In simple words, floating charge moves with the assets until a special event occurs, while fixed charge stays attached to one asset from the start. Both are important tools in company law to balance the needs of lenders and companies.

---

## Q7. What do you mean by 'Director' of the Company? Who can be director of the company? Discuss legal position of a director in the company.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

### Meaning of Director of the Company

A director is a person who is appointed to manage the affairs of a company. Directors are members of the Board of Directors, which is the governing body of the company. They take decisions, frame policies, and ensure that the company runs according to law.

In simple words, a director is like the **captain of a ship**. He guides the company and makes sure it moves in the right direction.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a company in Delhi, they may appoint **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** as directors to manage different parts of the business.

### Who Can Be Director of the Company

The Companies Act, 2013 in India lays down rules about who can be a director.

1. **Natural person**  
    Only a natural person can be a director. A company or firm cannot be appointed as director.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** is an individual living in Lucknow, he can be appointed as director. But his partnership firm cannot be appointed.  
2. **Competent person**  
    The person must be capable of entering into contracts. Minors or persons of unsound mind cannot be directors.  
    *Example*: **Krishna**, who is 30 years old and mentally sound, can be a director in Delhi. But a minor like a 16‑year‑old cannot.  
3. **Not disqualified**  
    A person who is undischarged insolvent or convicted of certain offences cannot be a director.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** has been declared insolvent in Varanasi, he cannot be appointed as director.  
4. **DIN requirement**  
    Every director must have a Director Identification Number (DIN).  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** wants to be a director in Patna, he must first obtain a DIN.  
   >***👍 DIN** is a unique 8‑digit number given by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in India to any person who wants to become a director of a company.*  
5. **Maximum and minimum limits**  
    A private company must have at least two directors, and a public company must have at least three. The maximum number of directors is fifteen, unless increased by special resolution.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, and **Satyam** form a public company in Allahabad, they must appoint at least three directors.

---

### Legal Position of a Director in the Company
The legal position of a director is special. A director is not an employee in the ordinary sense. He is considered in different roles under law.

1. **Agent of the company**  
    Directors act as agents of the company. They enter into contracts on behalf of the company.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** signs a contract in Kanpur for supply of machinery, he does it as agent of the company, not in his personal capacity.  
2. **Trustee of the company’s property**  
    Directors are trustees of the company’s assets. They must protect and use property for the benefit of the company.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** is a director in Delhi, he cannot use company land for his personal house. He holds it in trust for the company.  
3. **Officers of the company**  
    Directors are officers under the Companies Act. They are responsible for compliance with legal requirements.  
    *Example*: If **Krishna** is a director in Lucknow, he must ensure that annual returns are filed with the Registrar of Companies.  
4. **Fiduciary position**  
    Directors must act honestly and in good faith. They must avoid conflict of interest.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** is a director in Varanasi, he cannot secretly start a competing business using company secrets.  
   >**😀*Fiduciary VS Trustee \-***   
   *A trustee is a **specific type of fiduciary**. A trustee holds property or assets on behalf of someone else (the beneficiary) and must manage it according to the trust deed and law. Trusteeship is narrower and more formal than fiduciary duty. If **Krishna** in Lucknow is appointed as trustee of land for **Kanishth**, Krishna legally owns the land but only for the benefit of Kanishth. He cannot sell or use it for himself.*  
   *Fiduciary is a **broad concept**. It is anyone in a position of trust who must act in the best interest of another person or entity. If **Prateek** is a director in a company in Delhi, he is a fiduciary because he must act in the best interest of shareholders and not misuse company property for personal gain.*  
5. **Not servants of the company**  
    Directors are not servants. They are managers and decision‑makers.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** is a director in Patna, he is not like a salaried employee. He is part of the governing body.  
6. **Collective responsibility**  
    Directors act collectively as a Board. Individual directors cannot bind the company unless authorized.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** alone decides to sell company property in Allahabad without Board approval, the act is invalid.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company is formed in Delhi by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. They appoint **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** as directors. These directors act as agents when they sign contracts, as trustees when they handle company property, and as officers when they file legal documents. They must act honestly and in the interest of the company. If they misuse their position, they can be held liable.

---

**Conclusion**

A director is a person who manages the affairs of a company. Only natural, competent, and qualified persons can be directors. The legal position of a director is that of agent, trustee, officer, and fiduciary. Directors are not servants but managers who act collectively as a Board.

In simple words, directors are the guiding hands of a company. They must act honestly, protect company property, and follow the law. Their role is crucial because they balance the interests of shareholders, creditors, and the company itself.

## Q8. Define 'Quorum'. What is the quorum for a general meeting and board meeting? What cause of action should be adopted when the quorum is not complete at a general meetings?

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

### Meaning of Quorum

Quorum means the minimum number of members who must be present at a meeting for it to be valid. Without quorum, the meeting cannot proceed and decisions taken will not be legally binding.

**In simple words,** quorum ensures that important decisions are not taken by just one or two persons but by a reasonable number of members.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** call a general meeting of a company in Delhi, at least a minimum number of shareholders must be present. If only one person attends, the meeting cannot be held because quorum is not complete.

---

### Quorum for General Meeting

According to the Companies Act, 2013, the quorum for a general meeting depends on the number of members in the company. Quorum rules for **public vs private companies** under **Section 103** of the Companies Act, 2013\.

| Type of Company | Number of Members | Quorum Required | *Example* |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Public company** | Up to 1,000 members | **5 members personally present** | If **Prateek** and **Krishna** run a public company in Delhi with 800 members, at least 5 shareholders must attend. |
| **Public company** | More than 1,000 but up to 5,000 members | **15 members personally present** | If **Kanishth** is part of a public company in Varanasi with 3,000 members, at least 15 shareholders must attend. |
| **Public company** | More than 5,000 members | **30 members personally present** | If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** are in a public company in Patna with 10,000 members, quorum is 30 members. |
| **Private company** | Any number of members | **2 members personally present** | If **Saurabh** and **Satyam** form a private company in Lucknow with 2,000 members, quorum is just 2 members. Even if **Sachkeerat** is in a private company in Kanpur with 50 members, quorum is still 2\. |

### Quorum for Board Meeting

For a board meeting, the quorum is one‑third of the total strength of directors or two directors, whichever is higher.

**Comparison table for quorum in Board Meetings** under Section 174 of the Companies Act, 2013\.

| Total number of directors | One‑third of total strength | Minimum quorum required | *Example* |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **3 directors** | One‑third \= 1 | Quorum \= **2 directors** (higher of 1 or 2\) | If **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** are directors in Delhi, at least 2 must attend. |
| **4 directors** | One‑third ≈ 1.33 → rounded up \= 2 | Quorum \= **2 directors** | If **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, and **Satyam** are directors in Patna, at least 2 must attend. |
| **5 directors** | One‑third ≈ 1.66 → rounded up \= 2 | Quorum \= **2 directors** | If **Sachkeerat** joins as 5th director in Lucknow, at least 2 must attend. |
| **6 directors** | One‑third \= 2 | Quorum \= **2 directors** | If a company in Varanasi has 6 directors, at least 2 must attend. |
| **7 directors** | One‑third ≈ 2.33 → rounded up \= 3 | Quorum \= **3 directors** | If a company in Kanpur has 7 directors, at least 3 must attend. |
| **9 directors** | One‑third \= 3 | Quorum \= **3 directors** | If a company in Allahabad has 9 directors, at least 3 must attend. |
| **12 directors** | One‑third \= 4 | Quorum \= **4 directors** | If a company in Jaipur has 12 directors, at least 4 must attend. |

---

### Cause of Action When Quorum is Not Complete at General Meetings 

If quorum is not complete, the meeting cannot proceed. The Companies Act provides a clear procedure:

1. **Adjournment of meeting**  
    The meeting is adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and place.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** call a general meeting in Delhi but only one shareholder attends, the meeting is adjourned to the same day next week.  
2. **Quorum at adjourned meeting**  
    At the adjourned meeting, the members present, whatever their number, are considered quorum. 😂.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** alone attends the adjourned meeting in Varanasi, the meeting is valid and decisions can be taken.  
   >😂 *Under **Section 103 of the Companies Act, 2013**, if quorum is not present at the original general meeting, the meeting is **automatically adjourned** to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place.*

*At the **adjourned meeting**, the rule changes:*

1. ***Whoever is present, whatever their number, is treated as quorum.***  
   2. *This means even if only **one member** attends, the meeting is valid and can proceed.*

   **Why this rule exists:** It prevents minority shareholders from blocking company decisions by deliberately staying absent. The law ensures that business of the company cannot be stalled forever.

3. **Ensures fairness**  
    This rule ensures that minority shareholders cannot block decisions by staying absent.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** deliberately avoid attending a meeting in Patna to prevent quorum, the adjourned meeting can still proceed with those present.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi is run by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. They call a general meeting. Only **Raghavendra** attends, so quorum is not complete. The meeting is adjourned to the same day next week. At the adjourned meeting, **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** attend. Even if only two members are present, the meeting is valid because the law allows decisions to be taken at the adjourned meeting with whoever is present.

For a board meeting, if the company has five directors — **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, **Sachkeerat**, **Prateek**, and **Krishna** — quorum is two directors. If only **Saurabh** attends, the meeting cannot proceed. But if **Saurabh** and **Satyam** attend, quorum is complete and the meeting is valid.

---

**Conclusion**

Quorum means the minimum number of members required for a valid meeting. For general meetings, quorum depends on the number of shareholders. For board meetings, quorum is one‑third of directors or two, whichever is higher. If quorum is not complete at a general meeting, the meeting is adjourned and at the adjourned meeting, those present form quorum.

In simple words, quorum ensures that company decisions are taken with proper participation and not by a single person. It protects fairness and prevents misuse of power in meetings.

## Q9. What do you understand by winding up? Discuss the circumstance in which a company may be wound up on 'just and equitable' ground. 

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

### Meaning of Winding Up 

Winding up means the **process of closing a company**. It is the legal procedure by which a company’s business is stopped, its assets are sold, and the money is used to pay debts. After winding up, the company is dissolved and no longer exists.

**In simple words,** winding up is like **shutting down** a shop permanently. The company’s property is collected, debts are paid, and whatever remains is given to shareholders.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** run a company in Delhi and decide to stop business, they may wind up the company. The assets like machines and land are sold, creditors like **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** are paid, and the balance is distributed to shareholders like **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat**.

---

### Circumstances of Winding Up on Just and Equitable Ground

The Companies Act allows winding up of a company by the Tribunal on the ground that it is “just and equitable.” This means that even if the company is not insolvent, it may be wound up if fairness and justice require it.

Some important circumstances are:

1. **Deadlock in management**  
    If directors or shareholders are in constant conflict and cannot make decisions, the company cannot function.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** in Delhi are directors and always oppose **Kanishth**, no decision can be taken. The company may be wound up on just and equitable ground.  
2. **Loss of substratum (foundation)**  
    If the main object of the company fails, the company has no purpose.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** form a company in Varanasi to run a cinema hall, but the government bans cinema halls in that area, the company loses its purpose and may be wound up.  
3. **Oppression of minority shareholders**  
    If majority shareholders misuse power and oppress minority shareholders, winding up may be ordered.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** and **Satyam** hold majority shares in a company in Patna and pass resolutions to benefit themselves while harming **Sachkeerat**, the Tribunal may order winding up.  
4. **Fraudulent conduct of business**  
    If the company is being run for fraud or illegal purposes, winding up is just and equitable.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** run a company in Delhi but secretly use it for money laundering, winding up may be ordered.  
5. **Company becomes a bubble or sham**  
    If the company exists only on paper and has no real business, winding up may be ordered.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** registers a company in Lucknow but never starts business, and only uses it to avoid taxes, the Tribunal may wind it up.  
6. **Quasi‑partnership principles**  
    If the company is formed like a partnership with mutual trust, and that trust breaks down, winding up may be ordered.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, and **Saurabh** form a company in Allahabad based on friendship, but later **Satyam** and **Sachkeerat** exclude them from management, the Tribunal may wind up the company.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a textile company in Delhi is run by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. They constantly fight and no decision is possible. The company cannot function. In this case, the Tribunal may order winding up on just and equitable ground.

In another case, if **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** form a company in Varanasi to run a cinema hall, but the government closes all cinema halls, the company loses its purpose. Winding up is just and equitable.

If **Saurabh** and **Satyam** misuse their majority power in Patna to harm **Sachkeerat**, winding up may be ordered to protect fairness.

---

**Conclusion**

Winding up means closing a company and distributing its assets. It may be ordered by the Tribunal on just and equitable grounds even if the company is not insolvent. Circumstances include deadlock in management, loss of substratum, oppression of minority shareholders, fraudulent conduct, sham companies, and breakdown of mutual trust.

In simple words, winding up on just and equitable ground ensures that companies which cannot function fairly or have lost their purpose are closed in the interest of justice.

# 2023

## Q1. "A company is an artifical person created by law having a separate entity with a perpetual succession and a common seal." Explain this statement and discuss the major charateristics of a company.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

### Explanation of the Statement

A company is called an artificial person because it is created by law. It does not have a physical body like a human being, but it can act through its directors and officers. It can own property, enter into contracts, and sue or be sued in its own name.

A company has a separate legal entity. This means it is different from its members. The debts of the company are not the personal debts of its shareholders.

A company has perpetual succession. This means it continues to exist even if its members die, resign, or transfer their shares. The company’s life is not affected by changes in membership.

A company has a common seal. Traditionally, the seal was used as the official signature of the company. Though modern law has reduced its importance, it still symbolizes the company’s authority.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a company in Delhi, the company itself is a separate person in law. If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** leave the company, the company continues. If **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** join later, the company still remains the same legal entity.

> 👍 *A **company seal** (also called a **common seal**) is the official stamp or emblem of a company. It is used to mark important documents as the company’s formal approval or signature.*
> 
> *In modern times, the **requirement of a company seal has been removed under the Companies Act, 2013 in India**. Instead, companies now use **signatures of directors or company secretaries** and, increasingly, **digital signatures** to authenticate documents.*
> 
---

### Major Characteristics of a Company

1. **Artificial person**  
    A company is created by law. It cannot act on its own but acts through directors.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** form a company in Lucknow, the company itself cannot speak, but its directors sign contracts on its behalf.  
2. **Separate legal entity**  
    A company is different from its members. It can own property and sue in its own name.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** is a shareholder in a company in Varanasi, the company’s land belongs to the company, not to him personally.  
3. **Limited liability**  
    The liability of shareholders is limited to the amount unpaid on their shares.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** holds shares worth ₹1,00,000 in a company in Patna and has paid ₹80,000, his liability is only ₹20,000.  
4. **Perpetual succession**  
    The company continues even if members change.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** dies in Allahabad, the company he was part of continues with other members.  
5. **Common seal**  
    The company uses a common seal as its official signature.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh’s** company in Kanpur signs a contract, the seal is affixed to show company approval.  
6. **Transferability of shares**  
    Shares of a public company can be freely transferred.  
   (When we say *shares of a public company can be freely transferred*, it means that shareholders of a public company have the legal right to sell or transfer their shares to anyone without needing prior approval from the company or other shareholders.)  
      
   *Example*: If **Satyam** owns shares in a company in Lucknow, he can sell them to **Sachkeerat** without affecting the company’s existence.  
7. **Capacity to sue and be sued**  
    A company can file cases in court and can also be sued.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek’s** company in Delhi is not paid by a supplier, the company itself can sue the supplier.  
8. **Separate management and ownership**  
    Shareholders are owners, but directors manage the company.  
    *Example*: If **Krishna** and **Kanishth** are shareholders in Varanasi, but **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** are directors, the management is separate from ownership.  
9. **Regulation by law**  
    A company is regulated by the Companies Act. It must follow rules about meetings, accounts, and filings.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh’s** company in Allahabad fails to file annual returns, it can be penalized under law.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi is formed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. The company owns land and machinery. Even if **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** leave, the company continues. If **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** join, the company remains the same legal entity. The company can sue in its own name, has limited liability for shareholders, and is regulated by law.

---

**Conclusion**

A company is an artificial person created by law. It has a separate legal entity, perpetual succession, and a common seal. Its major characteristics include limited liability, transferability of shares, separate management, and regulation by law.

In simple words, a company is like a legal person that never dies. It continues despite changes in members, owns property in its own name, and acts through its directors. This makes the company a powerful and flexible form of business organization.

## Q2. Who is promoter? Write a note on the duties and liabilities of promoters. "A promoter is not a trustee or agent for the company but the stands in a fiduciary position towards it." Elucidate.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Who is a Promoter**

A promoter is a person who takes steps to form a company. He conceives the idea of starting a business, arranges capital, prepares documents, and brings the company into existence.

In simple words, a promoter is like the **architect of a company**. He plans, organizes, and sets up the company before it is registered.

For *example*, if **Prateek** in Delhi thinks of starting a textile company, he prepares the documents, arranges money, and registers the company. He is the promoter. If **Krishna** and **Kanishth** help him in arranging funds and convincing investors, they also act as promoters.

---

**Duties of Promoters**

Promoters have important duties because they stand in a fiduciary position towards the company.

1. **Duty of disclosure**  
    Promoters must disclose all material facts about the company, including any profit they make.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Varanasi buys land for ₹10 lakh and sells it to the company for ₹12 lakh, he must disclose this profit.  
2. **Duty not to make secret profits**  
    Promoters cannot secretly earn money at the cost of the company.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** in Patna arranges machinery for the company and secretly charges extra commission without telling the company, he violates his duty.  
3. **Duty of good faith**  
    Promoters must act honestly and in the best interest of the company.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Lucknow negotiates with suppliers, he must ensure fair terms for the company, not for himself.  
4. **Duty to prepare proper documents**  
    Promoters must prepare documents like Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association correctly.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam** in Kanpur drafts the Memorandum, he must ensure it clearly states the company’s objectives.  
5. **Duty to ensure compliance with law**  
    Promoters must follow all legal requirements for registration.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** in Allahabad files incorporation papers, he must ensure they are complete and accurate.

---

**Liabilities of Promoters**

Promoters are liable if they breach their duties.

1. **Liability for misrepresentation**  
    If promoters give false information in the prospectus, they are liable to compensate investors.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** issue a prospectus in Delhi claiming high profits but it is false, they must pay damages.  
2. **Liability for secret profits**  
    If promoters make secret profits, the company can recover them.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi sells property to the company at inflated price without disclosure, the company can recover the extra money.  
3. **Liability under Companies Act**  
    Promoters may face penalties for failing to comply with legal requirements.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Patna fails to file proper documents, he may be fined.  
4. **Liability to third parties**  
    Promoters are personally liable for contracts made before incorporation unless the company adopts them later.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** in Lucknow signs a contract with suppliers before the company is registered, he is personally liable until the company ratifies it.

**Promoter is not a Trustee or Agent but Fiduciary**

**Promoter is not a trustee**

* A trustee holds property on behalf of someone else.  
* But before incorporation, the company does not exist, so there is no “someone else” for the promoter to hold property for.

***Example*:** Suppose **Prateek** in Delhi buys land intending to give it to a company that he and **Krishna** are planning to form.

* At this stage, the company is not yet registered.  
* Since the company does not exist, **Prateek** cannot say he is holding the land “in trust” for the company.  
* He is holding it in his own name until the company is incorporated.  
* After incorporation, he may transfer the land to the company, but before that he is not a trustee.

**Promoter is not an agent**

* An agent acts on behalf of a principal.  
* But before incorporation, the company is not yet formed, so there is no principal.

***Example*:** Suppose **Kanishth** in Varanasi signs a contract with **Raghavendra** for supply of machinery, saying he is acting “for the company.”

* At this stage, the company is not yet registered.  
* Since the company does not exist, **Kanishth** cannot be its agent because there is no principal.  
* Legally, the contract is binding on **Kanishth** personally, not on the future company.  
* Only after incorporation, if the company adopts the contract, it becomes binding on the company.

👍 *An agent is someone who represents another person (the principal) in dealings with outsiders. Since the company does not exist, there is no “principal” who can appoint the promoter as an agent. So, if a promoter makes a contract before incorporation, he is personally responsible because there is no principal to bind.*

*A principal can be either a **person** or a **company**. But a company can only be a principal **after it is legally incorporated**, because only then does it exist as a separate legal entity.*

**Promoter is a fiduciary**

However, a promoter stands in a fiduciary position. This means he must act with honesty, loyalty, and fairness towards the company. He must disclose profits, avoid conflicts of interest, and work in good faith.

*Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad promotes a company, he is not its trustee or agent before incorporation. But he must act fairly, disclose profits, and protect the company’s interest.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose **Prateek** in Delhi promotes a company with help from **Krishna** and **Kanishth**. They prepare documents and arrange funds. If **Raghavendra** in Varanasi secretly earns profit by selling land to the company at a higher price, he must disclose it. If **Laukendra** in Patna misrepresents facts in the prospectus, he is liable. Though promoters are not trustees or agents, they must act in a fiduciary capacity, meaning they must be honest and loyal to the company.

---

**Conclusion**

A promoter is the person who brings a company into existence. He has duties of disclosure, honesty, and compliance, and liabilities for misrepresentation, secret profits, and pre‑incorporation contracts. Though not a trustee or agent, a promoter stands in a fiduciary position towards the company.

In simple words, a promoter is the guiding hand of a company’s birth, and the law ensures he acts fairly and honestly for the company’s benefit.

## Q3. Define Company. Discuss different kinds of companies. State the procedure for conversion of a public company into a private company.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

### Definition of Company

A company is an artificial person created by law. It has a separate legal entity, perpetual succession, and limited liability. It can own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued in its own name.

👍 In simple words, a company is a legal person different from its members. Even if members change, the company continues.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a company in Delhi, the company itself is a separate person in law. If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** leave, the company continues. If **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** join later, the company remains the same legal entity.

---

### Different Kinds of Companies

1. **Private company**  
    A private company restricts the right to transfer shares and limits the number of members to 2 to 200\. It cannot invite the public to subscribe to its shares.  
   **Exclusions**: Employees who hold shares while employed, or former employees who continue to hold shares after leaving, are not counted in the 200 limit.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** form a company in Lucknow with 50 members, it is a private company.  
2. **Public company**  
    A public company can invite the public to buy shares. It must have at least 7 members and 3 directors. Shares can be freely transferred.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** form a company in Varanasi with 1,000 shareholders, it is a public company.  
3. **One Person Company (OPC)**  
    An OPC has only one member. It is suitable for small businesses.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** in Patna wants to start a company alone, he can form an OPC.  
4. **Government company**  
    A government company is one in which at least 51% of shares are held by the government.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh’s** company in Allahabad is owned mostly by the central government, it is a government company.  
5. **Foreign company**  
    A foreign company is incorporated outside India but has a place of business in India.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam** works for a company in Kanpur that is registered in the USA but operates in India, it is a foreign company.  
6. **Section 8 company**  
    A Section 8 company is formed for **charitable purposes** like education, art, or social welfare. It **does not distribute profits** to members.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** in Kanpur forms a company to promote education for poor children, it is a Section 8 company.

---

### Procedure for Conversion of a Public Company into a Private Company

The Companies Act, 2013 allows a public company to convert into a private company by following certain steps.

1. **Board meeting**  
    The directors hold a board meeting to approve the proposal for conversion.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** are directors in Delhi, they call a board meeting to discuss conversion.  
2. **Special resolution**  
    A general meeting of shareholders is held, and a special resolution is passed to amend the Articles of Association.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** in Varanasi attend the meeting, they vote for conversion.  
3. **Approval of Tribunal**  
    The company must seek approval of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for conversion.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra’s** company in Patna wants to convert, it applies to NCLT for permission.  
4. **Filing with Registrar**  
    The company files the special resolution and amended Articles with the Registrar of Companies.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad files the documents, the Registrar records the conversion.  
5. **Issue of new certificate**  
    After approval, the Registrar issues a fresh certificate of incorporation showing the company as private.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam’s** company in Kanpur receives the certificate, it becomes a private company.  
6. **Effect of conversion**  
    After conversion, the company must follow rules applicable to private companies, such as restriction on transfer of shares and limit on number of members.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat’s** company in Kanpur converts, it cannot invite the public to buy shares anymore.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a public company in Delhi is run by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** with 1,000 shareholders. They decide to convert it into a private company. They hold a board meeting, pass a special resolution, apply to NCLT, and file documents with the Registrar. After approval, the Registrar issues a new certificate. The company now becomes private, with restrictions on transfer of shares and a limit of 200 members.

---

**Conclusion**

A company is an artificial person created by law with a separate legal entity. There are different kinds of companies such as private, public, OPC, government, foreign, and Section 8 companies. A public company can be converted into a private company by following a legal procedure involving board approval, special resolution, NCLT approval, and filing with the Registrar.

In simple words, the law allows flexibility so that companies can change their structure according to their needs, while ensuring fairness and compliance with rules.

## ~~Q4. "Majority will have its way but minority must be allowed to have say." Discuss the concept of prevention of opperssion an mismanagement in context of relevant cases ?~~ 
For Answer See Question no. 11 on Page 131\.

## Q5. Who are Directors? What is procedure for appointment of Direct ? Discuss qualification and disqualification of Director.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Who are Directors**

Directors are persons **elected** or **appointed** to manage the affairs of a company. They act as the **brain of the company** and take decisions on its behalf. Since a company is an artificial person, it cannot act on its own. Directors act as agents of the company and ensure that the company runs according to law and its objectives.

For *example*, if **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a company in Delhi, they appoint directors to manage daily operations. If **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** are chosen as directors, they will take decisions for the company.

---

**Procedure for Appointment of Directors**

The Companies Act, 2013 lays down the procedure for appointment of directors.

1. **First directors**  
    The first directors are usually named in the Articles of Association. If not named, the subscribers to the Memorandum become the first directors.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** in Lucknow subscribe to the Memorandum, they automatically become first directors.  
   **Memorandum** \= defines *what* the company can do (its scope and objectives).  
   **Articles** \= define *how* the company will do it (its internal rules and procedures).  
2. **Appointment in general meeting**  
    Directors are appointed by shareholders in the general meeting through an ordinary resolution. (An ordinary resolution means a decision taken by a company’s members with a simple majority vote in a general meeting i.e. more than 50% of members present and voting must support it.)  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** in Varanasi attend the annual general meeting, they can vote to appoint **Laukendra** as director.  
3. **Appointment by Board**  
    The Board of Directors can appoint additional directors, alternate directors, or nominee directors.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad is appointed by the Board as an additional director, he holds office until the next general meeting.  
4. **Appointment by third parties**  
    Sometimes, agreements with financial institutions or government allow them to nominate directors.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam** in Kanpur is nominated by a bank that financed the company, he becomes a director.  
5. **Appointment by proportional representation**  
    In some companies, directors are appointed by proportional representation to ensure minority shareholders also get representation.

Proportional representation means directors are appointed in proportion to the number of shares held. This ensures that even minority shareholders (those holding fewer shares) get a chance to appoint directors, instead of only majority shareholders controlling the board.

**Better *Example*:** Suppose a public company in Delhi has **1,000 shares** in total.

* **Prateek** and **Krishna** together hold **600 shares** (majority).  
* **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** together hold **300 shares** (minority).  
* **Sachkeerat** holds **100 shares** (small minority).

If directors were appointed only by simple majority voting, **Prateek** and **Krishna** could elect all directors, leaving others with no representation.

But under **proportional representation**:

* For every 200 shares, one director can be appointed.  
* So, **Prateek** and **Krishna** (600 shares) can appoint **3 directors**.  
* **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** (300 shares) can appoint **1 director**.  
* **Sachkeerat** (100 shares) cannot appoint a full director alone, but if he joins with others holding 100 shares, together they can appoint **1 director**.

This way, even minority shareholders like **Sachkeerat** get representation on the board.

**In short:** Proportional representation prevents majority shareholders from monopolizing the board. It ensures that minority shareholders also have a voice in management.

---

**Qualifications of Directors**

The law does not prescribe strict educational qualifications, but certain conditions must be met.

1. **Natural person**  
    Only a natural person can be a director.  
    *Example*: **Prateek** can be a director, but a company itself cannot be appointed as director.  
2. **Competence**  
    The person must be capable of entering into a contract.  
    *Example*: **Krishna** in Delhi, being an adult of sound mind, can be appointed.  
3. **Director Identification Number (DIN)**  
    Every director must obtain a DIN from the government.  
    *Example*: **Kanishth** in Varanasi applies for DIN before becoming a director.  
4. **Consent to act**  
   When someone is appointed as a director, the law requires that person to give written consent confirming that they agree to take up the responsibility. This ensures that no one is forced or unknowingly made a director.

👍 *Example* \- Suppose a company in Patna is holding its annual general meeting.

* The shareholders decide to appoint Raghavendra as a director.  
* Before his name can be officially entered with the Registrar of Companies, Raghavendra must sign a written consent form saying: *“I agree to act as director of this company.”*  
* Only after this consent is filed with the Registrar, his appointment becomes valid.

If Prateek in Delhi or Krishna in Lucknow were also appointed, they too would need to give written consent. Without this, their appointment would not be legally recognized.

5. **Share qualification (if required)**

   The Articles of Association (AOA) may require that a person must hold a certain number of shares before he or she can be appointed as a director.  
   Once that person satisfies the shareholding requirement and is appointed, only then does he become a director.  
     
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** in Lucknow holds 500 shares as required, he qualifies to become a director.

---

**Disqualifications of Directors**

A person cannot be appointed as director if he suffers from certain disqualifications.

1. **Unsound mind**  
    If declared of unsound mind by a court, he cannot be a director.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad is declared mentally unfit, he is disqualified.  
2. **Insolvent (bankrupt)**  
    If a person is an undischarged insolvent, he cannot be a director.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam** in Kanpur has not repaid debts and is declared insolvent, he is disqualified.  
3. **Criminal conviction**  
    If convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment of six months or more, he is disqualified.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** in Kanpur is convicted for fraud, he cannot be a director.  
4. **Failure to pay calls on shares**  
    If a person fails to pay calls on shares for six months, he is disqualified.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** in Delhi does not pay calls on his shares, he cannot continue as director.

👍 *When a company issues shares, it may not ask for the full value at once.*

*Instead, it demands money in parts, called **calls** (first call, second call, etc.).*

*If a shareholder does not pay these calls within six months, he is **disqualified from being a director**.*

*The idea is that someone who does not fulfill his financial obligation to the company should not manage its affairs.*

5. **Disqualification under law**  
    If disqualified by any court or law, he cannot be a director.  
    *Example*: If **Krishna** in Lucknow is barred by SEBI, he is disqualified.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi is formed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. They appoint **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** as directors in the general meeting. **Saurabh** is appointed as an additional director by the Board. **Satyam** is nominated by a bank. **Sachkeerat** represents minority shareholders. All directors must have DIN and give consent. If any director becomes insolvent or is convicted of fraud, he is disqualified.

---

**Conclusion**

Directors are the persons who manage the affairs of a company. They are appointed through Articles, general meetings, Board decisions, or nominations. They must be natural persons with DIN and consent. Disqualifications include insolvency, unsound mind, criminal conviction, and failure to pay calls.

In simple words, directors are the guiding hands of a company. They ensure the company runs smoothly, but they must meet qualifications and avoid disqualifications to protect the company and its stakeholders.

## Q6. Define dividend. Explain the rules regarding declaration and payment of dividend.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Definition of Dividend**

A dividend is the **part of profit of a company that is distributed to its shareholders**. It is a reward given to members for investing their money in the company. Dividend is declared by the company out of its profits and paid in proportion to the shares held by each shareholder.

In simple words, dividend is the share of profit that a company gives to its owners.

For *example*, if **Prateek** in Delhi holds 500 shares of a company and the company declares a dividend of ₹10 per share, he will receive ₹5,000. If **Krishna** in Lucknow holds 200 shares, he will receive ₹2,000.

---

**Rules Regarding Declaration of Dividend**

1. **Declaration only out of profits**  
    Dividend can be declared only out of profits of the company, either current year’s profit or past accumulated profits.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi’s company earns ₹10 lakh profit, it can declare dividend. If there is no profit, dividend cannot be declared.  
2. **Depreciation must be provided**  
    Before declaring dividend, the company must provide for depreciation on assets.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Patna’s company has machinery, it must deduct depreciation before calculating distributable profit.  
3. **Transfer to reserves**  
    A certain percentage of profit must be transferred to reserves before declaring dividend, as per law.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra** in Lucknow’s company earns ₹20 lakh, it must transfer part of it to reserves before paying dividend.  
4. **Declaration by shareholders**  
    Dividend is recommended by the Board of Directors but declared by shareholders in the general meeting.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad is a director, he recommends dividend. Shareholders like **Satyam** and **Sachkeerat** approve it in the meeting.  
5. **Interim dividend**  
    The Board of Directors can declare interim dividend during the year before final accounts are prepared.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek’s** company in Delhi earns high profits mid‑year, directors may declare interim dividend.

---

**Rules Regarding Payment of Dividend**

1. **Payment only to registered shareholders**  
    Dividend can be paid only to persons whose names appear in the register of members.  
    *Example*: If **Krishna** in Lucknow sells his shares to **Kanishth**, dividend will be paid to the person whose name is registered at the time of declaration.  
2. **Payment in proportion to shares held**  
    Dividend is paid according to the number of shares held.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Patna holds 100 shares and **Laukendra** in Lucknow holds 200 shares, **Raghavendra** gets half the dividend of **Laukendra**.  
3. **Payment in cash only**  
    Dividend must be paid in cash, not in kind. It can be paid by cheque, warrant, or electronic transfer.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad is a shareholder, he receives dividend by bank transfer, not by goods.  
4. **Time limit for payment**  
    Dividend must be paid within 30 days of declaration.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam** in Kanpur’s company declares dividend on 1st June, it must be paid by 30th June.  
5. **Unpaid dividend**  
    If dividend is not claimed, it must be transferred to an unpaid dividend account within 7 days. After 7 years, it is transferred to Investor Education and Protection Fund.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** in Kanpur forgets to claim his dividend, the company transfers it to unpaid dividend account.  
6. **Penalty for default**  
    If a company fails to pay dividend within the time limit, directors are liable for punishment and fine.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** as directors fail to pay dividend in time, they may face penalty.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi earns ₹50 lakh profit. **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** as directors recommend dividend of ₹5 per share. Shareholders like **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** approve it in the general meeting. Dividend is paid within 30 days by bank transfer. If any shareholder does not claim it, the company transfers it to unpaid dividend account.

---

**Conclusion**

Dividend is the portion of profit distributed to shareholders as a reward for their investment. It can be declared only out of profits after providing for depreciation and reserves. It is recommended by directors and declared by shareholders. Dividend must be paid in cash within 30 days, only to registered members, and in proportion to shares held.

In simple words, dividend is the company’s way of sharing its success with its owners, but strict rules ensure fairness, transparency, and protection of investors.

---

## Q7. Explain the legal provisions relating to the Annual General Meeting of a company.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Definition of Annual General Meeting**

An Annual General Meeting (AGM) is a **meeting of the shareholders of a company** held once in every year. It is a **statutory requirement** under the Companies Act, 2013\. The purpose of an AGM is to give shareholders an opportunity to receive information about the company, approve accounts, declare dividends, and appoint directors and auditors.

👍 In simple words, AGM is the yearly meeting where owners of the company come together to review and decide important matters.

---

**Legal Provisions Relating to AGM**

1. **Applicability**  
    Every public company must hold an AGM. Private companies are not required to hold AGM unless they are specifically directed.  
    *Example*: If **Prateek** and **Krishna** form a public company in Delhi, they must hold AGM every year. If **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** form a private company in Varanasi, they are not required to hold AGM.  
2. **First AGM**  
    The first AGM **must be held within nine months** from the end of the first financial year. If the first AGM is held within this period, the company need not hold another AGM in that year.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra’s** company in Patna is incorporated in January 2025, it must hold its first AGM by September 2026\.  
3. **Subsequent AGMs**  
    After the first AGM, every company must hold AGM once in every year. The gap between two AGMs must not exceed fifteen months.

   * 30 members if total members \> 5000  
      *Example*: If **Prateek’s** company in Delhi has 800 members, quorum is 5\. If **Krishna’s** company in Lucknow has 2000 members, quorum is 15\.  
7. **Filing with Registrar**  
    Resolutions passed in AGM must be filed with Registrar of Companies within 30 days.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth’s** company in Varanasi declares dividend in AGM, resolution must be filed with Registrar.  
8. **Penalty for default**  
    If a company fails to hold AGM, it is liable for **fine**. Officers in default may also be punished.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra’s** company in Patna does not hold AGM, both company and directors may face penalty.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a public company in Delhi is managed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. They hold AGM every year. In the AGM, shareholders like **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** attend. They receive financial statements, approve dividend, and appoint auditors. Notice is sent 21 days before the meeting. Quorum is maintained. Resolutions are filed with Registrar. If they fail to hold AGM, penalties are imposed.

---

**Conclusion**

Annual General Meeting is a statutory requirement for public companies. It ensures transparency, accountability, and participation of shareholders in important decisions. Legal provisions require timely notice, proper quorum, approval of accounts, declaration of dividend, and appointment of directors and auditors.

In simple words, AGM is the yearly platform where shareholders review the company’s performance and exercise their rights. It strengthens corporate governance and protects the interests of investors.

## Q8. Define share. What are different kinds of shares that a company may issue? Can a company issue irredeemable preference share?

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Definition of Share**

A share is a **unit of ownership** in a company. It represents the interest of a shareholder in the company’s capital. A person who buys shares becomes a member and owner of the company to the extent of the shares held. Shares give rights such as receiving dividends, voting in meetings, and sharing in profits.

👍 In simple words, a share is a piece of the company’s ownership.

For *example*, if **Prateek** in Delhi buys 100 shares of a company, he becomes part owner. If **Krishna** in Lucknow buys 200 shares, his ownership is larger than **Prateek’s**.

---

**Different Kinds of Shares**

The Companies Act, 2013 allows companies to issue mainly two kinds of shares: **equity shares** and **preference shares**.

1. **Equity shares**

   * Equity shares are ordinary shares.  
   * They carry voting rights and represent real ownership of the company.  
   * Dividend on equity shares is not fixed. It depends on profits.  
   * *Example*: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi holds 500 equity shares, he can vote in meetings and receive dividend when profits are declared.  
2. **Preference shares**

   * Preference shares give preferential rights over equity shares.  
   * Preference shareholders get dividend at a fixed rate before equity shareholders.  
   * They also get priority in repayment of capital at the time of winding up.  
   * *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Patna holds preference shares, he will receive dividend first, even before **Laukendra** who holds equity shares.

****Example*** Imagine a company in Delhi with two types of shareholders:*

* ***Prateek** and **Krishna** hold **equity shares**.*  
* ***Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** hold **preference shares**.*

*The company earns ₹10 lakh profit.*

* *Preference shareholders (**Kanishth** and **Raghavendra**) are promised a fixed dividend of 8%.*  
* *So they get their dividend first. Suppose their dividend comes to ₹80,000.*  
* *After paying them, the remaining profit is given to equity shareholders (**Prateek** and **Krishna**) as dividend.*

*Now, if the company shuts down:*

* *Preference shareholders (**Kanishth** and **Raghavendra**) get back their capital first.*  
* *Only after that, equity shareholders (**Prateek** and **Krishna**) get whatever is left.*

**Preference shares can be of different types:**

**Cumulative preference shares**

* If dividend is not paid this year, it is carried forward and paid later.  
* *Example*: **Saurabh** in Allahabad holds cumulative preference shares. No dividend this year → next year he gets this year’s dividend plus the new one.

**Non‑cumulative preference shares**

* Dividend does not carry forward. If not declared in a year, it is lost.  
* *Example*: **Satyam** in Kanpur holds non‑cumulative preference shares. No dividend this year → he gets nothing, even if profits come later.

**Redeemable preference shares**

* Company must repay the money after a fixed time or when it decides.  
* *Example*: **Sachkeerat** in Lucknow holds redeemable preference shares. After 10 years, the company returns his money.

**Participating preference shares**

* Get fixed dividend first, and also share extra profits with equity shareholders.  
* *Example*: **Prateek** in Delhi holds participating preference shares. He gets fixed dividend plus a bonus share of profits.

**Non‑participating preference shares**

* Only get fixed dividend, no share in extra profits.  
* *Example*: **Krishna** in Lucknow holds non‑participating preference shares. He gets only the fixed dividend, nothing extra.

>  **In short:**
> 
> * Cumulative → missed dividend is carried forward.  
> * Non‑cumulative → missed dividend is lost.  
> * Redeemable → money is repaid after time.  
> * Participating → fixed dividend \+ extra profits.  
> * Non‑participating → only fixed dividend.
>
---

**Can a Company Issue Irredeemable Preference Shares?**

Under the Companies Act, 2013, a company **cannot issue irredeemable preference shares**.

**What is an irredeemable preference share?**

* A **preference share** normally has to be repaid (redeemed) by the company after a fixed time.  
* An **irredeemable preference share** means a share that the company would **never repay**. The shareholder would keep it forever, and the company would never return the money invested.

**Why law does not allow it?**

* The Companies Act, 2013 says **no company can issue irredeemable preference shares**.  
* All preference shares must be **redeemable within 20 years**.  
* This rule exists because if shares were irredeemable, the company would be stuck with that liability forever, and shareholders would never get their money back.

**Simple *example*** Suppose **Prateek** in Delhi buys preference shares of a company.

* If they are **redeemable**, the company promises to return his money after 10 years.  
* If they were **irredeemable**, the company would **never return his money** — he would only keep getting dividends.  
* Since the law prohibits this, **Prateek** can only buy redeemable preference shares.

**👍 In short:** Irredeemable preference share \= a share that is **never repaid** by the company. Law says → **Not allowed in India.** All preference shares must be redeemable within 20 years.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi issues 1,000 shares. **Prateek** and **Krishna** buy equity shares. **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** buy preference shares. **Laukendra** buys cumulative preference shares, **Saurabh** buys non‑cumulative preference shares, **Satyam** buys redeemable preference shares, and **Sachkeerat** buys participating preference shares. Each type of share gives different rights. But none of them can buy irredeemable preference shares because the law does not allow it.

---

**Conclusion**

A share is a unit of ownership in a company. The main types are equity shares and preference shares. Preference shares may be cumulative, non‑cumulative, redeemable, participating, or non‑participating. Equity shares carry voting rights and variable dividends, while preference shares carry fixed dividends and priority in repayment.

In simple words, shares are the way people become owners of a company. But the law ensures fairness by allowing only redeemable preference shares and prohibiting irredeemable ones, so that companies remain flexible and shareholders are protected.

## Q9. What do you mean by 'Compulsory Winding up' of a company ? What are the grounds for compulsory winding up? Discuss. 

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**Meaning of Compulsory Winding Up**

Compulsory winding up means **closing down a company by the order of the court or tribunal**. It is not voluntary. It happens when the company fails to follow the law or acts against public interest. In this process, the company’s assets are sold, liabilities are paid, and the company is dissolved.

In simple words, compulsory winding up is when the court forces a company to shut down.

For *example*, if **Prateek** and **Krishna** run a company in Delhi and the company commits **fraud**, the tribunal may order **compulsory winding up**.

---

**Grounds for Compulsory Winding Up**

The Companies Act, 2013 provides several grounds on which a company may be compulsorily wound up by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

1. **Company unable to pay debts**  
    If a company cannot pay its debts, creditors may apply for winding up.  
    *Example*: If **Kanishth’s** company in Varanasi owes ₹50 lakh to suppliers and cannot pay, creditors can approach the tribunal.  
2. **Special resolution by company**  
    If the company itself passes a special resolution that it should be wound up, the tribunal may order winding up.  
    *Example*: If **Raghavendra’s** company in Patna passes a resolution to close, tribunal may approve.  
3. **Company acts against national interest**  
    If the company acts against the sovereignty, integrity, or security of India, or against friendly relations with foreign states, it can be wound up.  
    *Example*: If **Laukendra’s** company in Lucknow secretly helps an enemy country, tribunal may order winding up.  
4. **Fraudulent conduct of business**  
    If the company is formed for fraudulent purposes or its business is conducted fraudulently, it can be wound up.  
    *Example*: If **Saurabh’s** company in Allahabad cheats investors by fake schemes, tribunal may order winding up.  
5. **Default in filing financial statements or annual returns**  
    If the company fails to file financial statements or annual returns for five consecutive years, it can be wound up.  
    *Example*: If **Satyam’s** company in Kanpur does not file returns for five years, tribunal may order winding up.  
6. **Tribunal opinion – just and equitable**  
    If the tribunal thinks it is just and equitable to wind up the company, it may order so.  
    *Example*: If **Sachkeerat’s** company in Lucknow has continuous disputes among directors and cannot function, tribunal may decide winding up is fair.

---

**Procedure of Compulsory Winding Up**

1. Petition is filed by creditors, company, or government.  
2. Tribunal hears the case and decides if grounds exist.  
3. If satisfied, tribunal orders winding up.  
4. Liquidator is appointed to sell assets and pay debts.  
5. After settlement, company is dissolved.

*Example*: If **Prateek’s** company in Delhi cannot pay debts, creditors file petition. Tribunal orders winding up. Liquidator sells assets, pays creditors, and dissolves the company.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Lucknow run by **Krishna** and **Kanishth** fails to pay debts of ₹1 crore. Creditors file petition. Tribunal finds company insolvent. It orders compulsory winding up. Liquidator sells company’s factory, pays creditors, and closes the company. Shareholders like **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** lose their investment.

---

**Conclusion**

Compulsory winding up is the forced closure of a company by tribunal order. Grounds include inability to pay debts, fraudulent conduct, acting against national interest, default in filing returns, or when tribunal finds it just and equitable.

In simple words, compulsory winding up protects creditors, investors, and the public by shutting down companies that fail to follow law or act unfairly. It ensures that dishonest or failing companies do not continue to harm society.

## Q10. Write notes on any two of the following:

(a) Article of Association  
(b) NCLAT  
(c) Doctrine of Indoor Management

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.

---

**(a) Articles of Association**

* Articles of Association (AOA) are the internal rules of a company.  
* They regulate how the company is managed, including meetings, voting, issue of shares, and appointment of directors.  
* They are subordinate to the Memorandum of Association.  
* *Example*: If **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth** form a company in Delhi, the AOA will say how board meetings are conducted, how **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra** can transfer shares, and how **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** can vote in meetings.

---

**(b) NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal)**

* NCLAT is a tribunal that hears appeals against orders of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).  
* It was established under the Companies Act, 2013\.  
* It also hears appeals against orders of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI).  
* *Example*: If **Prateek’s** company in Delhi is ordered by NCLT to be wound up, and **Krishna** feels the order is unfair, he can appeal to NCLAT. If **Kanishth** in Varanasi has a dispute about insolvency resolution, he can also approach NCLAT.

---

**(c) Doctrine of Indoor Management**

* This doctrine protects outsiders dealing with a company.  
* Outsiders are not expected to know the internal rules of the company. They can assume that internal procedures have been followed.  
* It is an exception to the doctrine of constructive notice (which says outsiders must know the contents of MOA and AOA).  
* *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Patna signs a contract with a company, he can assume that directors like **Laukendra** and **Saurabh** have followed internal rules. Even if the company failed to follow some internal procedure, **Raghavendra** is protected.  
* But if **Satyam** in Kanpur knows about fraud or forgery, he cannot claim protection under this doctrine.

---

**Conclusion**  
 Articles of Association are the internal rule book of a company. NCLAT is the appellate tribunal for company law and insolvency matters. The Doctrine of Indoor Management protects outsiders dealing with a company by allowing them to assume that internal rules are properly followed.

In simple words, these provisions ensure smooth functioning of companies, fair resolution of disputes, and protection of outsiders in business dealings.

---

Here’s a **quick comparison chart** that links **MOA vs AOA** and shows how the **Doctrine of Indoor Management** protects outsiders.

---

| Aspect | Memorandum of Association (MOA) | Articles of Association (AOA) | Doctrine of Indoor Management |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Meaning** | Charter of the company – defines scope and objectives | Internal rule book – regulates internal management | Protects outsiders dealing with company assuming internal rules are followed |
| **Purpose** | Shows *what* the company can do | Shows *how* the company will do it | Outsiders need not check compliance with AOA procedures |
| **Binding on** | Company and outsiders | Company and members | Protects outsiders (like creditors, investors) |
| **Contents** | Name, office, objects, liability, capital clauses | Rules about meetings, voting, directors, share transfer | Outsiders can rely on company acts without investigating internal approvals |
| **Legal position** | Supreme document, cannot be violated | Subordinate to MOA | Exception to doctrine of constructive notice |
| ***Example*** | If **Prateek** and **Krishna** form a textile company in Delhi, MOA states its object is textile manufacturing | AOA states how **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** as directors will conduct meetings | If **Laukendra** signs a contract with the company, he can assume **Saurabh** and **Satyam** followed AOA rules; he is protected even if they missed a step |
| **Key point** | Defines external limits | Defines internal rules | Protects outsiders from internal irregularities |

---

**In short:**

* **MOA** \= defines *scope* of company.  
* **AOA** \= defines *rules* of company.  
* **Doctrine of Indoor Management** \= protects outsiders by letting them assume internal rules are followed.

## Q1. What do you mean by 'Corporate Personality'? What are the advantages of corporate personality? Discuss.

Here’s a detailed and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.  

---

**Meaning of Corporate Personality**

Corporate personality means that a company is treated as a separate legal person in the eyes of law. Once a company is registered under the Companies Act, it becomes an artificial person different from its members. It can own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued in its own name.  

> In simple words, corporate personality means the company has its own identity separate from the people who own it.  

For *example*, if **Prateek** in Delhi and **Krishna** in Lucknow start a company, the company itself becomes a separate person in law. Even if **Prateek** or **Krishna** leave, the company continues to exist.  

---

**Advantages of Corporate Personality**

1. **Separate legal entity**  
   The company is different from its members. It can own property and enter into contracts in its own name.  
   *Example*: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi owns shares in a company, the company’s property does not belong to him personally. The company owns it.  

2. **Limited liability**  
   Members are liable only up to the amount unpaid on their shares. Their personal property is safe.  
   *Example*: If **Raghavendra** in Patna holds 100 shares of ₹10 each and has paid ₹8 per share, his liability is only ₹200. His house or car cannot be taken for company debts.  

3. **Perpetual succession**  
   The company continues even if members die or leave.  
   *Example*: If **Laukendra** in Lucknow dies, the company continues. His shares are transferred to heirs, but the company remains alive.  

4. **Right to sue and be sued**  
   The company can file cases in court and cases can be filed against it.  
   *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad’s company is cheated by a supplier, the company itself can sue the supplier. If the company fails to pay debts, creditors can sue the company, not **Saurabh** personally.  

5. **Separate property**  
   The property of the company belongs to the company, not to its members.  
   *Example*: If **Satyam** in Kanpur is a shareholder, he cannot claim ownership of the company’s building. The building belongs to the company.  

6. **Transferability of shares**  
   Shares can be easily transferred from one person to another without affecting the company’s existence.  
   *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** in Lucknow sells his shares to **Prateek**, the company continues without disturbance.  

7. **Professional management**  
   Because of corporate personality, companies can appoint professional managers to run the business.  
   *Example*: If **Krishna** and **Kanishth** are shareholders, they can appoint **Raghavendra** as a professional director to manage the company.  

8. **Large capital**  
   Corporate personality allows companies to raise large capital by issuing shares to many people.  
   *Example*: If **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** invest together, the company can collect huge funds which no single person could arrange alone.  

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi is formed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. The company owns a factory. Even though **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** are shareholders, none of them can claim the factory as personal property. If the company earns profit, it distributes dividend. If the company suffers loss, shareholders lose only up to their shareholding. The company continues even if some members leave or die.  

---

**Conclusion**

Corporate personality means the company is a separate legal person different from its members. It enjoys advantages such as separate legal entity, limited liability, perpetual succession, right to sue and be sued, separate property, transferability of shares, professional management, and ability to raise large capital.  

In simple words, corporate personality gives a company its own identity, protects members from unlimited liability, and ensures continuity and growth. It is the foundation of modern business organizations and makes companies powerful vehicles for economic development.

## Q2. Define 'Memorandum of Association'. Discuss its various clauses.

Here’s a detailed and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as *example*s.  

---

**Definition of Memorandum of Association**

The Memorandum of Association (MOA) is the charter of a company. It is the most important document in the formation of a company. It defines the scope of activities of the company and sets out the relationship between the company and the outside world. It lays down the objectives for which the company is formed and the limitations within which it can operate.  

> In simple words, MOA is the foundation of a company. It tells what the company can do and what it cannot do.  

For *example*, if **Prateek** in Delhi and **Krishna** in Lucknow form a company, the MOA will state whether the company is for textile business, trading, or manufacturing. The company cannot go beyond the objects mentioned in the MOA.  

---

**Clauses of Memorandum of Association**

1. **Name Clause**  
   This clause states the name of the company. A public company must end with “Limited” and a private company must end with “Private Limited.”  
   *Example*: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi forms a public company, its name may be “Kanishth Textiles Limited.” If **Raghavendra** in Patna forms a private company, its name may be “Raghavendra Traders Private Limited.”  

2. **Registered Office Clause**  
   This clause states the state in which the registered office of the company is situated. It helps to determine jurisdiction of the Registrar of Companies.  
   *Example*: If **Laukendra** in Lucknow forms a company, the MOA will mention that the registered office is in Uttar Pradesh.  

3. **Object Clause**  
   This clause defines the objectives of the company. It has two parts:  
   - Main objects: The primary purpose for which the company is formed.  
   - Other objects: Ancillary or incidental objects (side activities) to support the main purpose.  
   *Example*: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad forms a company for manufacturing bicycles, the main object will be “manufacture and sale of bicycles.” Other objects may include “import of raw materials” or “export of bicycles.”  

4. **Liability Clause**  
    This clause tells us how much members of a company are responsible for paying if the company has debts.

    It protects members from paying more than what they agreed.

    **Two types:**

    **1. Company limited by shares**

    Members pay only the amount left unpaid on their shares.

    *Example*: Prateek in Delhi buys 100 shares of ₹10 each. He has already paid ₹8 per share. If the company has debts, he will pay only ₹200 more (₹2 × 100). Nothing beyond that.

    **2. Company limited by guarantee**

    Members promise to pay a fixed amount if the company is closed and has debts.

    *Example*: Krishna in Lucknow signs the MOA of a guarantee company and agrees to pay ₹5,000 if needed. If the company is wound up, he will pay only ₹5,000, not more.

   This clause states the liability of members. In a company limited by shares, liability is limited to the unpaid amount on shares. In a company limited by guarantee, liability is limited to the amount members agree to contribute.  
   
   ***Example***: If **Satyam** in Kanpur holds 100 shares of ₹10 each and has paid ₹8 per share, his liability is only ₹200. He cannot be asked to pay more.  

5. **Capital Clause**  
    **Capital Clause – Simple Meaning**

    - It tells how much money (authorized capital) the company is allowed to raise by issuing shares.

    - It also shows how this capital is divided into shares of a fixed value.

    Easy Example Suppose Sachkeerat in Lucknow starts a company.

    - He decides the company can raise up to ₹10 lakh. He divides this into 1 lakh shares of ₹10 each. This information is written in the Capital Clause of the MOA.

    So, the Capital Clause is like a statement: “Our company can raise ₹10 lakh, and each share is worth ₹10.”

    > In short: Capital Clause = maximum money company can collect + how it is split into shares.
    
   This clause states the authorized capital of the company and its division into shares.  
   *Example*: If **Sachkeerat** in Lucknow forms a company with authorized capital of ₹10 lakh divided into 1 lakh shares of ₹10 each, the MOA will mention this in the capital clause.  

6. **Association Clause (Subscription Clause)**  
   This clause contains the declaration by subscribers that they agree to form the company and take shares. At least two persons are required for a private company and seven for a public company.  
   *Example*: If **Prateek**, **Krishna**, **Kanishth**, **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, and **Satyam** sign the MOA, they declare their intention to form a public company. Each of them agrees to take a certain number of shares.  

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi is formed by **Prateek**, **Krishna**, and **Kanishth**. The MOA states:  
- Name: “Delhi Traders Limited.”  
- Registered office: Delhi.  
- Objects: Trading in textiles and related goods.  
- Liability: Limited by shares.  
- Capital: ₹20 lakh divided into 2 lakh shares of ₹10 each.  
- Association: Signed by **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** along with the promoters.  

This MOA defines the scope of the company. If the company tries to start a hotel business, it will be invalid because it is not mentioned in the object clause.  

---

**Conclusion**

The Memorandum of Association is the charter of the company. It defines the scope of activities and sets limits on what the company can do. Its clauses include name, registered office, objects, liability, capital, and association.  

In simple words, MOA is the foundation stone of a company. It protects shareholders and outsiders by clearly stating the company’s purpose and limits. Without MOA, a company cannot be registered, and without following MOA, a company cannot legally operate.  

---  
## 3\. What do you mean by 'Prospectus'? Explain the statutory provisions of 'Deemed Prospectus' and 'Abridged Prospectus'.

Here’s a detailed and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as examples.

---

**Meaning of Prospectus**

A prospectus is a legal document issued by a company to invite the public to subscribe for its shares or debentures. It contains details about the company, its financial position, the nature of business, and the terms of issue of securities. The purpose of a prospectus is to give full and true information to investors so that they can make an informed decision.

In simple words, a prospectus is like an advertisement with legal details, telling people why they should invest in the company.

For example, if **Prateek** in Delhi and **Krishna** in Lucknow form a public company and want to raise money from the public, they must issue a prospectus. The prospectus will show the company’s objectives, capital, directors, and financial position.

---

**Statutory Provisions of Deemed Prospectus**

* Sometimes a company does not give a prospectus directly to the public.  
* Instead, it gives its shares or debentures to another party like a bank, financial institution, or issuing house.  
* That party then sells those shares to the public.  
* In such cases, the law says: the document used by that party will be treated as a **deemed prospectus**.

Key points:

1. If a company allots shares or debentures to an issuing house, and that issuing house offers them to the public, the offer document is considered a deemed prospectus.  
2. The deemed prospectus must contain all the information required in a regular prospectus.  
3. The company and directors are responsible for the contents of the deemed prospectus.

Example: Suppose **Kanishth** in Varanasi’s company allots shares to a financial institution. That institution issues a document to sell shares to the public in Allahabad. Even though the company did not issue the prospectus directly, the law treats that document as a deemed prospectus. If false information is given, **Kanishth** and other directors are liable.

**In short:** Deemed prospectus \= when shares are offered to the public through another party, not directly by the company.

---

**Statutory Provisions of Abridged Prospectus**

An abridged prospectus is a shorter version of the prospectus. It contains only the most important information in a summarized form.

Key points:

1. Every application form for shares or debentures must be accompanied by an abridged prospectus.  
2. The abridged prospectus must contain all essential information like company name, capital, objectives, directors, and financial highlights.  
3. The purpose is to save cost and time, and to give investors only the key facts in simple language.  
4. If an application form is issued without an abridged prospectus, the company and officers are liable for penalty.

Example: If **Raghavendra** in Patna applies for shares in a company, he receives an application form with an abridged prospectus attached. It shows the company’s authorized capital, main objects, directors like **Laukendra** and **Saurabh**, and financial highlights. This helps **Raghavendra** decide quickly whether to invest.

Another example: If **Satyam** in Kanpur gets an application form without an abridged prospectus, the company is violating the law.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Lucknow managed by **Sachkeerat** wants to raise money.

* It issues a full prospectus to invite the public.  
* Later, it allots shares to a financial institution, which offers them to the public. That document becomes a deemed prospectus.  
* When people like **Prateek**, **Krishna**, **Kanishth**, **Raghavendra**, **Laukendra**, **Saurabh**, and **Satyam** apply for shares, each application form must have an abridged prospectus attached.

---

**Conclusion**

A **prospectus is a legal invitation** to the public to invest in a company. A deemed prospectus arises when securities are offered to the public through an intermediary, and the law treats that document as a prospectus. An abridged prospectus is a short version attached to every application form, giving key information to investors.

In simple words, the prospectus ensures transparency, the deemed prospectus prevents companies from escaping responsibility, and the abridged prospectus makes investment information easy and quick for the public. Together, they protect investors and promote fair practices in the corporate world.

## 4\. What is 'Share'? Discuss the different types of Shares. Can preferene shares be converted in equity shares?

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as examples.

---

**Meaning of Share**

A share is a unit of ownership in a company. It represents the interest of a shareholder in the company’s capital. A person who buys shares becomes part owner of the company. Shares give rights such as receiving dividends, voting in meetings, and sharing in profits.

In simple words, a share is like a small piece of the company. Whoever holds it becomes a co‑owner.

Example: If **Prateek** in Delhi buys 100 shares of a company, he becomes part owner. If **Krishna** in Lucknow buys 200 shares, his ownership is bigger than **Prateek’s**.

---

**Different Types of Shares**

Under the Companies Act, 2013, a company can issue mainly two types of shares: **equity shares** and **preference shares**.

1. **Equity Shares**

   * These are ordinary shares.  
   * Equity shareholders are real owners of the company.  
   * They have voting rights.  
   * Dividend is not fixed. It depends on profits.  
   * Example: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi holds 500 equity shares, he can vote in meetings and get dividend when profits are declared.  
2. **Preference Shares**

   * Preference shareholders get priority over equity shareholders.  
   * They receive dividend at a fixed rate before equity shareholders.  
   * They also get priority in repayment of capital at the time of winding up.  
   * Example: If **Raghavendra** in Patna holds preference shares, he will get dividend first, even before **Laukendra** who holds equity shares.

Preference shares can be of different types:

* **Cumulative preference shares**  
   Dividend not paid in a year is carried forward and paid later.  
   Example: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad holds cumulative preference shares, and dividend is not paid this year, he will get it next year along with arrears.  
* **Non‑cumulative preference shares**  
   Dividend does not carry forward. If not declared in a year, it is lost.  
   Example: If **Satyam** in Kanpur holds non‑cumulative preference shares, and dividend is not declared this year, he cannot claim it later.  
* **Redeemable preference shares**  
   These shares are repaid by the company after a fixed period or at the option of the company.  
   Example: If **Sachkeerat** in Lucknow holds redeemable preference shares, the company may repay his capital after 10 years.  
* **Participating preference shares**  
   These shareholders get fixed dividend and may also share extra profits with equity shareholders.  
   Example: If **Prateek** in Delhi holds participating preference shares, he gets fixed dividend plus extra share of profits.  
* **Non‑participating preference shares**  
   These shareholders only get fixed dividend and no share in extra profits.  
   Example: If **Krishna** in Lucknow holds non‑participating preference shares, he only gets fixed dividend.

---

**Can Preference Shares be Converted into Equity Shares?**

Yes, preference shares can be converted into equity shares if the terms of issue allow it.

* The company must mention in the prospectus or resolution that preference shares are convertible.  
* Conversion gives preference shareholders the rights of equity shareholders, including voting rights and variable dividend.

Example: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi holds convertible preference shares, after 5 years they may be converted into equity shares. Then he will get voting rights like **Raghavendra** and **Laukendra**.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi issues 1,000 shares.

* **Prateek** and **Krishna** buy equity shares.  
* **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** buy preference shares.  
* **Laukendra** buys cumulative preference shares.  
* **Saurabh** buys non‑cumulative preference shares.  
* **Satyam** buys redeemable preference shares.  
* **Sachkeerat** buys participating preference shares.

Each type of share gives different rights. If the company allows conversion, **Kanishth’s** preference shares may later become equity shares.

---

**Conclusion**

A share is a unit of ownership in a company. The main types are equity shares and preference shares. Equity shares carry voting rights and variable dividends. Preference shares carry fixed dividends and priority in repayment. Preference shares may be cumulative, non‑cumulative, redeemable, participating, or non‑participating.

In simple words, shares are the way people become owners of a company. Preference shares can be converted into equity shares if the company allows it. This gives flexibility to investors and helps companies raise funds in different ways.

## 5\. What is 'Debenture'? Discuss the usual features and kinds of debentures.

Here’s a clear and exam‑style answer in simple sentences, with relatable names and Indian places as examples.

---

**Meaning of Debenture**

A debenture is a written document issued by a company acknowledging a debt. It is a certificate of loan given by the company to the public. Debenture holders are creditors of the company, not owners. A debenture usually carries a fixed rate of interest, which is paid regularly.

In simple words, a debenture is like a loan certificate given by the company to people who lend money to it.

Example: If **Prateek** in Delhi lends ₹1 lakh to a company, the company issues him a debenture. He will get fixed interest every year, but he will not become an owner of the company.

---

**Usual Features of Debentures**

1. **Written document**  
    A debenture is always in writing. It is a legal certificate of debt.  
    Example: If **Krishna** in Lucknow lends money to a company, he gets a written debenture certificate.  
2. **Fixed rate of interest**  
    Debenture holders get interest at a fixed rate, whether the company makes profit or not.  
    Example: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi holds debentures at 10% interest, he will get 10% every year even if the company has no profit.  
3. **No ownership rights**  
    Debenture holders are creditors, not owners. They do not have voting rights.  
    Example: If **Raghavendra** in Patna holds debentures, he cannot vote in company meetings like shareholders.  
4. **Repayment**  
    Debentures must be repaid after a fixed period.  
    Example: If **Laukendra** in Lucknow holds debentures for 10 years, the company must repay him after 10 years.  
5. **Priority in repayment**  
    At the time of winding up, debenture holders are paid before shareholders.  
    Example: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad holds debentures, he will get his money back before **Satyam** who holds shares.  
6. **Security**  
    Debentures may be secured by company assets or unsecured.  
    Example: If **Sachkeerat** in Lucknow holds secured debentures, he has a claim on company property if the company fails to pay.

---

**Kinds of Debentures**

1. **Secured debentures**  
    These are backed by company assets. If the company fails to pay, debenture holders can claim the assets.  
    Example: If **Prateek** in Delhi holds secured debentures, he can claim company property if payment is not made.  
2. **Unsecured debentures**  
    These are not backed by assets. Debenture holders are ordinary creditors.  
    Example: If **Krishna** in Lucknow holds unsecured debentures, he has no claim on company property.  
3. **Redeemable debentures**  
    These are repaid by the company after a fixed period.  
    Example: If **Kanishth** in Varanasi holds redeemable debentures for 5 years, the company must repay him after 5 years.  
4. **Irredeemable debentures**  
    These are not repaid during the lifetime of the company. They are repaid only at winding up.  
    Example: If **Raghavendra** in Patna holds irredeemable debentures, he will get his money only when the company closes.  
5. **Convertible debentures**  
    These can be converted into shares of the company after a certain time.  
    Example: If **Laukendra** in Lucknow holds convertible debentures, after 3 years they may be converted into equity shares.  
6. **Non‑convertible debentures**  
    These cannot be converted into shares. They remain as debt instruments.  
    Example: If **Saurabh** in Allahabad holds non‑convertible debentures, he will always remain a creditor.  
7. **Bearer debentures**  
    These are transferable by delivery. Whoever holds the debenture is the owner.  
    Example: If **Satyam** in Kanpur holds bearer debentures and gives them to **Sachkeerat** in Lucknow, **Sachkeerat** becomes the holder.  
8. **Registered debentures**  
    These are recorded in the company’s register. Transfer requires proper procedure.  
    Example: If **Prateek** in Delhi holds registered debentures, his name is entered in the company’s register.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Delhi issues debentures.

* **Prateek** buys secured debentures.  
* **Krishna** buys unsecured debentures.  
* **Kanishth** buys redeemable debentures.  
* **Raghavendra** buys irredeemable debentures.  
* **Laukendra** buys convertible debentures.  
* **Saurabh** buys non‑convertible debentures.  
* **Satyam** buys bearer debentures.  
* **Sachkeerat** buys registered debentures.

Each type gives different rights, but all debenture holders are creditors, not owners.

---

**Conclusion**

A debenture is a certificate of debt issued by a company. It carries fixed interest and must be repaid. Debenture holders are creditors, not owners, and they have priority in repayment over shareholders. Debentures may be secured or unsecured, redeemable or irredeemable, convertible or non‑convertible, bearer or registered.

In simple words, debentures are a way for companies to borrow money from the public. They give safety to investors through fixed interest and priority in repayment, while allowing companies to raise large funds for business.

    If the tribunal thinks it is just and equitable to wind up the company, it may order so.  
    Example: If **Sachkeerat’s** company in Lucknow has continuous disputes among directors and cannot function, tribunal may decide winding-up is fair.

---

**Procedure of Winding-up by Tribunal**

1. **Petition filed** – A petition for winding-up may be filed by the company, creditors, or government.  
    Example: If **Prateek’s** company in Delhi cannot pay debts, creditors file petition.

---

**Simple Illustration**

Suppose a company in Lucknow run by **Laukendra** and **Saurabh** fails to pay debts of ₹1 crore. Creditors file petition. Tribunal finds company insolvent. It orders winding-up. Liquidator sells company’s assets, pays creditors, and closes the company. Shareholders like **Prateek**, **Krishna**, **Kanishth**, **Raghavendra**, **Satyam**, and **Sachkeerat** lose their investment.

---

**Conclusion**

Winding-up means closing down a company and dissolving it. Winding-up by tribunal is compulsory and happens when the company fails to pay debts, acts fraudulently, acts against national interest, defaults in filing returns, or when tribunal finds it just and equitable.

In simple words, winding-up by tribunal protects creditors, shareholders, and society by shutting down companies that fail to follow law or act unfairly. It ensures that dishonest or failing companies do not continue to harm the public.

## Q1. What is corporate personality? What are the effects of corporate personality?  
---

**1\. What is corporate personality? What are the effects of corporate personality?**

Corporate personality is one of the most important concepts in company law. When a company is registered under the Companies Act, it becomes a separate legal entity distinct from its members. This means the company has its own identity, separate from the shareholders, directors, or employees. The principle was firmly established in the famous case of *Salomon v. Salomon & Co. Ltd.* (1897), where the House of Lords held that once a company is incorporated, it is treated as a separate person in the eyes of law.

In simple words, corporate personality means that the company is like a “legal person.” It can own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued in its own name. For example, if Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form a company in Lucknow, the company itself will be recognized as a separate person. Even though they are shareholders, the company will own its assets, not the individuals.

**Effects of corporate personality**

1. **Separate legal entity**  
    The company is distinct from its members. For example, if Raghavendra and Laukendra start a company in Varanasi, the debts of the company are not automatically their personal debts. The company itself is responsible.  
2. **Limited liability of members**  
    One of the biggest advantages of corporate personality is limited liability. Shareholders are only liable to the extent of their shares. If Saurabh invests ₹1,00,000 in a company in Allahabad, and the company suffers losses of ₹10,00,000, Saurabh will not be personally liable beyond his investment.  
3. **Perpetual succession**  
    The company continues to exist even if members die, retire, or transfer their shares. For example, if Satyam and Sachkeerat form a company in Kanpur, and later Satyam passes away, the company will continue to exist. This ensures stability and continuity.  
4. **Right to own property**  
    The company can own property in its own name. The property does not belong to shareholders individually. For instance, if a company buys land in Prayagraj, the land belongs to the company, not to Prateek or Krishna, even if they are shareholders.  
5. **Capacity to sue and be sued**  
    Since the company is a separate person, it can file cases in court and can also be sued. For example, if a company in Lucknow enters into a contract with Kanishth and fails to deliver goods, Kanishth can sue the company, not the individual shareholders.  
6. **Transferability of shares**  
    Corporate personality allows shares to be transferred easily. This means ownership can change without affecting the company’s existence. For example, if Laukendra sells his shares to Raghavendra, the company continues unaffected.  
7. **Taxation**  
    The company is taxed separately from its members. This means the profits of the company are subject to corporate tax, and if dividends are distributed, shareholders pay tax separately on their income.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Suppose Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form “Lucknow Traders Pvt. Ltd.” They invest money and buy a warehouse. The warehouse belongs to the company, not to them personally. If the company takes a loan and fails to repay, only the company’s assets can be used to recover the loan. Their personal houses or cars cannot be taken away. This shows how corporate personality protects individuals and encourages business.

**Conclusion**  
 Corporate personality is the foundation of modern company law. It ensures that a company is treated as a separate person, distinct from its members. The effects include separate legal entity, limited liability, perpetual succession, ownership of property, ability to sue and be sued, transferability of shares, and separate taxation. This principle encourages entrepreneurship because individuals like Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth can start businesses without risking their entire personal wealth. Thus, corporate personality is essential for the growth of trade, commerce, and industry in India.

## Q2. Critically analyze the grounds with relevant cases wherein Judiciary has lifted corporate veil.  
---

**2\. Critically analyze the grounds with relevant cases wherein Judiciary has lifted corporate veil**

The doctrine of corporate personality says that a company is a separate legal entity, distinct from its members. However, in certain situations, courts have looked beyond this separate personality and held members or directors personally liable. This process is called “lifting the corporate veil.” It means the judiciary disregards the company’s separate identity to see the real individuals behind it.

The principle was first recognized in *Salomon v. Salomon & Co. Ltd.* (1897), where the company was treated as separate. But later, courts realized that sometimes this principle is misused to commit fraud, evade law, or avoid obligations. In such cases, the veil of incorporation is lifted.

**Grounds where veil is lifted**

1. **Fraud or improper conduct**  
    If the company is used as a device to commit fraud, courts will not allow members to hide behind corporate personality.  
    Example: If Prateek and Krishna form a company in Lucknow only to cheat creditors, the court can hold them personally liable.  
    Case: *Delhi Development Authority v. Skipper Construction Co. (1996)* – the Supreme Court held that the corporate veil can be lifted when the company is used to defraud people.  
2. **Evasion of tax**  
    When companies are formed to avoid tax liability, courts may disregard corporate personality.  
    Example: If Kanishth and Raghavendra form a company in Varanasi only to transfer profits and avoid paying tax, the court can pierce the veil.  
    Case: *Sir Dinshaw Maneckjee Petit case (1927)* – the company was formed only to avoid tax, and the veil was lifted.  
3. **Avoidance of welfare legislation**  
    If companies are created to avoid labor laws or welfare legislation, courts intervene.  
    Example: If Laukendra forms multiple small companies in Allahabad to avoid giving workers benefits under labor laws, the court may treat all companies as one.  
    Case: *Workmen of Associated Rubber Industries Ltd. v. Associated Rubber Industries Ltd.* (1986) – the veil was lifted to ensure workers’ rights.  
4. **Agency or sham companies**  
    Sometimes a company is only an agent or sham of another. Courts may treat the parent and subsidiary as one.  
    Example: If Saurabh forms a subsidiary in Kanpur only to escape liabilities of the parent company, the court may hold the parent responsible.  
    Case: *Gilford Motor Co. v. Horne (1933)* – the company was formed to avoid contractual obligations, and veil was lifted.  
5. **Public interest and national security**  
    Courts may lift the veil to protect public interest or national security.  
    Example: If Satyam and Sachkeerat form a company in Prayagraj with foreign links that threaten national security, the veil can be lifted.  
    Case: *LIC v. Escorts Ltd.* (1986) – the Supreme Court lifted the veil to examine the real ownership of shares in the interest of national security.  
6. **Determination of enemy character**  
    During wartime, courts may lift the veil to see if the company is controlled by enemy nationals.  
    Example: If Prateek forms a company in Lucknow but all shareholders are enemy nationals, the veil will be lifted.  
    Case: *Daimler Co. Ltd. v. Continental Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd.* (1916) – the veil was lifted to determine enemy character.

**Critical analysis**  
 The doctrine of lifting the veil is an exception to corporate personality. Courts use it cautiously, only when justice demands. While corporate personality encourages business, misuse of this principle can harm society. Therefore, lifting the veil ensures accountability. However, critics argue that frequent lifting of the veil may discourage entrepreneurship, as members may fear personal liability. Thus, balance is necessary: veil should be lifted only in cases of fraud, evasion, or public interest.

**Conclusion**  
 Corporate personality is the backbone of company law, but it is not absolute. Courts have lifted the veil in cases of fraud, tax evasion, avoidance of welfare laws, sham companies, public interest, and enemy character. This ensures that individuals like Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth cannot misuse the company form to harm society. The doctrine of lifting the veil is therefore a safeguard against abuse of corporate personality, ensuring justice and fairness in corporate jurisprudence.

## Q3. Do you agree that in modern corporate Jurisprudence the doctrine of ultra vires has diluted? Discuss with relevant cases and provisions.  
---

**3\. Do you agree that in modern corporate jurisprudence the doctrine of ultra vires has diluted? Discuss with relevant cases and provisions.**

The doctrine of *ultra vires* is a fundamental principle in company law. The term “ultra vires” means “beyond powers.” When a company is incorporated, its powers and objectives are defined in the Memorandum of Association (MOA). If the company acts beyond those powers, such acts are called *ultra vires* and are void. This doctrine was meant to protect shareholders and creditors by ensuring that the company only engages in activities for which it was formed.

For example, if Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form a company in Lucknow with the object of manufacturing textiles, and later the company starts dealing in real estate, such an act would be *ultra vires* the MOA and void. Neither shareholders nor directors can ratify it.

**Traditional importance of ultra vires doctrine**  
 In early company law, the doctrine was very strict. Courts held that any act beyond the MOA was void and could not be validated.  
 Case: *Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. Ltd. v. Riche* (1875) – the company entered into a contract to finance railway construction, which was beyond its MOA. The House of Lords held the contract void as *ultra vires*.

This strict approach ensured that companies stuck to their stated objectives, protecting investors and creditors.

**Dilution in modern jurisprudence**  
 Over time, the doctrine has been diluted due to several reasons:

1. **Wide drafting of objects clause**  
    Companies now draft very broad objects clauses in their MOA. For example, if Raghavendra and Laukendra form a company in Varanasi, they may include “to carry on any lawful business” in their MOA. This makes almost every activity intra vires (within powers).  
2. **Statutory reforms**  
    The Companies Act, 2013 in India has reduced the importance of the doctrine. Section 4 requires companies to state their objects, but courts and regulators allow wide interpretation. Moreover, acts beyond MOA are not automatically void if they are within the law.  
3. **Protection of third parties**  
    Modern jurisprudence protects outsiders dealing with the company. If Saurabh contracts with a company in Kanpur, he should not suffer just because the company acted beyond its MOA. Courts often uphold such contracts to protect innocent third parties.  
4. **Shift towards directors’ accountability**  
    Instead of declaring acts void, modern law holds directors accountable for misuse of powers. For example, if Satyam and Sachkeerat misuse company funds for activities not in MOA, shareholders can sue them for breach of duty, but the contract itself may still bind the company.  
5. **Case law showing dilution**

   * *Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.* (1932) – courts moved towards protecting contracts unless there was clear illegality.  
   * In India, courts have emphasized that ultra vires acts harming shareholders can be challenged, but outsiders should not be penalized.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Suppose Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form “Lucknow Textiles Ltd.” with the object of manufacturing cloth. Later, the company invests in a hotel business in Allahabad. Traditionally, this would be void as *ultra vires*. But under modern law, the act may still be valid if shareholders approve and if it does not harm creditors. The directors may be questioned, but the hotel contract itself may not be struck down.

**Critical analysis**  
 The dilution of ultra vires doctrine has both advantages and disadvantages.

* **Advantages:** It gives companies flexibility to diversify and grow. It protects outsiders who deal with the company in good faith.  
* **Disadvantages:** It reduces the strict control over directors and may allow misuse of corporate funds.

Thus, while the doctrine still exists, its rigid application has been softened. Courts now focus more on protecting stakeholders rather than mechanically invalidating acts.

**Conclusion**  
 Yes, in modern corporate jurisprudence, the doctrine of ultra vires has been diluted. Earlier, any act beyond MOA was void, but now companies draft broad objects, statutes protect third parties, and directors are held accountable instead of invalidating contracts. This ensures flexibility for businesses like those formed by Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth, while still safeguarding shareholders and creditors. The doctrine has not disappeared, but its strictness has been reduced to balance corporate growth with accountability.

## Q4. What is effect of mis-statement in prospectus? What remedies are available in companies Act for this?  
---

**4\. What is effect of mis-statement in prospectus? What remedies are available in Companies Act for this?**

A prospectus is a document issued by a company to invite the public to subscribe for its shares or debentures. It contains important information about the company such as its financial position, objectives, risks, and management. Since investors rely on the prospectus to decide whether to invest, the law requires that the statements in it must be true and not misleading. If there is a mis-statement in the prospectus, it can cause serious harm to investors and lead to liability for the company and its officers.

**Meaning of mis-statement in prospectus**  
 A mis-statement means any false, misleading, or untrue statement of material fact, or omission of important information, in the prospectus. For example, if Prateek and Krishna form a company in Lucknow and issue a prospectus claiming that the company has assets worth ₹10 crore, but in reality it only has ₹2 crore, this is a mis-statement. Investors like Kanishth or Raghavendra who rely on this false information may suffer losses.

**Effects of mis-statement in prospectus**

1. **Civil liability**

   * The company and its directors can be held liable to compensate investors who suffered losses due to mis-statement.  
   * Example: If Laukendra invests in a company in Varanasi based on a false prospectus, he can sue the company for damages.  
2. **Criminal liability**

   * Under Section 34 and 35 of the Companies Act, 2013, if a prospectus contains untrue statements, the persons responsible (directors, promoters, experts) can be punished with imprisonment and fine.  
   * Example: If Saurabh issues a prospectus in Kanpur with false claims about profits, he may face criminal charges.  
3. **Rescission of contract**

   * Investors can cancel their contract to buy shares if they were induced by mis-statement.  
   * Example: If Satyam buys shares of a company in Prayagraj based on false claims in the prospectus, he can return the shares and get his money back.  
4. **Loss of reputation**

   * Mis-statements damage the credibility of the company. Future investors may hesitate to trust it.

**Remedies available under Companies Act, 2013**

1. **Rescission of contract**

   * Investors can cancel their purchase of shares and demand refund.  
   * Example: If Sachkeerat invests in a company in Allahabad based on false information, he can rescind the contract.  
2. **Damages for deceit**

   * Investors can sue for compensation under the law of torts if they prove that mis-statement was fraudulent.  
   * Case: *Derry v. Peek* (1889) – directors were held liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.  
3. **Damages under Companies Act**

   * Section 35 provides that every person who authorized the issue of prospectus containing untrue statements is liable to pay compensation to investors.  
4. **Criminal punishment**

   * Section 34 provides that if a prospectus includes false or misleading statements, the responsible persons can face imprisonment up to 10 years and fine up to ₹25 lakh.  
5. **Action against experts**

   * If experts like auditors or valuers give false statements in the prospectus, they can also be held liable.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Suppose Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form “Lucknow Developers Ltd.” They issue a prospectus claiming that the company owns 100 acres of land in Allahabad. In reality, they own only 20 acres. Raghavendra and Laukendra invest based on this false claim. Later, when the truth comes out, they suffer losses. Under the Companies Act, they can rescind their contracts, demand refund, and sue the directors for damages. The directors may also face criminal charges for fraud.

**Critical analysis**  
 The law on mis-statement in prospectus is strict because it protects investors. However, courts also recognize that directors may not always be personally guilty if they acted honestly and relied on expert advice. Therefore, liability depends on whether the mis-statement was fraudulent, negligent, or innocent. This balance ensures that genuine mistakes are not punished harshly, but deliberate fraud is strictly dealt with.

**Conclusion**  
 Mis-statement in prospectus is a serious offence because it misleads investors and damages trust in corporate markets. The effects include civil liability, criminal liability, rescission of contract, and loss of reputation. Remedies under the Companies Act include rescission, damages, compensation, and punishment of responsible persons. This ensures that individuals like Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth cannot mislead investors like Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, or Sachkeerat. Thus, strict rules about prospectus maintain fairness, transparency, and confidence in corporate investments.

Would you like me to continue with **Question 5 (Shares, types of shares, and conversion of preference shares into equity shares)** in the same style?

## Q5. What is share? What are different types of share? Can preference shares be converted in equity shares?  
---

**5\. What is share? What are different types of share? Can preference shares be converted in equity shares?**

A share is the basic unit of ownership in a company. When a person buys shares, they become a shareholder and own a part of the company. Shares represent the capital of the company and give certain rights to shareholders, such as receiving dividends, voting in meetings, and sharing profits.

For example, if Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form a company in Lucknow with a capital of ₹10 lakh divided into 1 lakh shares of ₹10 each, then each share represents a small portion of ownership. If Raghavendra buys 10,000 shares, he owns 10% of the company.

**Types of shares under Companies Act, 2013**

1. **Equity shares**

   * These are the most common type of shares.  
   * Equity shareholders are the real owners of the company. They have voting rights and share in profits through dividends.  
   * Example: If Laukendra buys equity shares in a company in Varanasi, he can vote in meetings and receive dividends when profits are declared.  
   * Equity shareholders bear the highest risk because they are paid last in case of liquidation.  
2. **Preference shares**

   * Preference shareholders have preferential rights over equity shareholders in two matters:  
      (a) Receiving dividends before equity shareholders.  
      (b) Repayment of capital in case of winding up.  
   * Example: If Saurabh holds preference shares in a company in Kanpur, he will get his dividend before equity shareholders like Satyam or Sachkeerat.  
   * However, preference shareholders usually do not have voting rights, except in special circumstances.

**Further classification of preference shares**  
 Preference shares can be of different types:

* **Cumulative preference shares**: If dividend is not paid in one year, it accumulates and must be paid later.  
* **Non-cumulative preference shares**: Dividend does not accumulate; if not declared in a year, it is lost.  
* **Redeemable preference shares**: These can be repaid by the company after a fixed period.  
* **Irredeemable preference shares**: These cannot be repaid during the lifetime of the company (though Companies Act, 2013 does not allow irredeemable shares now).  
* **Convertible preference shares**: These can be converted into equity shares after a certain period.  
* **Non-convertible preference shares**: These cannot be converted into equity shares.

**Can preference shares be converted into equity shares?**  
 Yes, preference shares can be converted into equity shares if the terms of issue allow it. Section 55 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides that companies can issue convertible preference shares. The conversion must be approved by shareholders and mentioned in the prospectus or terms of issue.

Example: Suppose Prateek and Krishna issue convertible preference shares in “Lucknow Traders Ltd.” to Kanishth. After 5 years, the company allows conversion. Kanishth’s preference shares are converted into equity shares, giving him voting rights and ownership like other equity shareholders.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Imagine “Varanasi Textiles Ltd.” issues both equity and preference shares. Raghavendra buys equity shares, while Laukendra buys preference shares. At the end of the year, the company earns profit. Laukendra, being a preference shareholder, gets his dividend first. Raghavendra gets dividend later, depending on remaining profits. If Laukendra’s shares are convertible, after 3 years he can convert them into equity shares and start voting in meetings.

**Critical analysis**  
 Equity shares are risky but give ownership and voting rights. Preference shares are safer because they get priority in dividends and repayment, but they lack control. Conversion of preference shares into equity shares balances these interests. It allows investors like Laukendra or Saurabh to start with safer preference shares and later become equity shareholders when they want more control.

**Conclusion**  
 Shares represent ownership in a company. Equity shares give voting rights and ownership, while preference shares provide priority in dividends and repayment. Preference shares can be cumulative, non-cumulative, redeemable, convertible, etc. Yes, preference shares can be converted into equity shares if terms of issue allow. This flexibility ensures that investors like Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat can choose the type of share that suits their risk and control preferences. Thus, the law provides balance between safety and ownership in corporate investments.

## Q6. What is dividend? What are rules and procedure about issuing dividend? Discuss in detail.  
---

**6\. What is dividend? What are rules and procedure about issuing dividend? Discuss in detail.**

A dividend is the portion of profit that a company distributes to its shareholders. It is a reward given to shareholders for investing their money in the company. Dividends can be paid in cash, shares, or other forms. The decision to declare dividends is taken by the Board of Directors, but it must follow the rules laid down in the Companies Act, 2013\.

For example, if Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form a company in Lucknow and earn a profit of ₹50 lakh, they may decide to distribute ₹10 lakh as dividend among shareholders like Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat. This distribution is called dividend.

**Types of dividend**

1. **Final dividend** – Declared at the annual general meeting (AGM) after accounts are approved.  
2. **Interim dividend** – Declared by the Board of Directors between two AGMs, usually when the company earns good profits mid-year.  
3. **Special dividend** – Declared in special circumstances, such as extraordinary profits.  
4. **Bonus shares (stock dividend)** – Instead of cash, the company issues additional shares to shareholders.

**Rules about issuing dividend under Companies Act, 2013**

1. **Declaration of dividend**

   * Dividend can only be declared out of profits of the company (current year or past profits transferred to reserves).  
   * It cannot be declared out of capital.  
   * Example: If “Varanasi Textiles Ltd.” earns ₹20 lakh profit, it can declare dividend. But if it suffers losses, it cannot declare dividend from capital.  
2. **Board and shareholders’ approval**

   * Interim dividend can be declared by the Board.  
   * Final dividend must be recommended by the Board and approved by shareholders in AGM.  
   * Example: If Saurabh is a director in “Kanpur Traders Ltd.”, he can recommend dividend, but shareholders like Satyam and Sachkeerat must approve it in AGM.  
3. **Transfer to reserves**

   * Before declaring dividend, a certain percentage of profits may be transferred to reserves. This ensures financial stability.  
4. **Payment timeline**

   * Dividend must be paid within 30 days of declaration.  
   * Example: If “Lucknow Developers Ltd.” declares dividend on 1st June, it must pay shareholders like Prateek and Krishna by 30th June.  
5. **Unpaid dividend**

   * If dividend is not claimed by shareholders, it must be transferred to “Unpaid Dividend Account” within 7 days.  
   * After 7 years, it goes to Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF).  
6. **Restrictions**

   * Dividend cannot be declared if the company has defaulted in repayment of deposits, debentures, or statutory dues.  
   * Example: If “Allahabad Builders Ltd.” has not repaid loans, it cannot declare dividend.

**Procedure for declaring dividend**

1. **Board meeting** – Directors meet and decide the amount of dividend.  
2. **Recommendation** – Board recommends dividend in AGM.  
3. **Approval** – Shareholders approve dividend in AGM.  
4. **Transfer to reserves** – Profits are transferred to reserves as required.  
5. **Payment** – Dividend is paid to shareholders within 30 days.  
6. **Unpaid dividend handling** – Any unpaid dividend is transferred to Unpaid Dividend Account.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Suppose “Lucknow Traders Ltd.” earns ₹50 lakh profit. Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth as directors recommend a dividend of ₹5 per share. In AGM, shareholders like Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat approve it. The company transfers part of profit to reserves and pays dividend within 30 days. If Sachkeerat forgets to claim his dividend, it is transferred to Unpaid Dividend Account.

**Critical analysis**  
 Dividends are important because they reward shareholders and maintain trust. However, excessive dividend distribution may harm the company’s growth, as profits are not reinvested. Therefore, companies must balance between rewarding shareholders and retaining profits for expansion.

**Conclusion**  
 Dividend is the distribution of profit to shareholders. The Companies Act, 2013 lays down strict rules: it must be declared out of profits, approved by Board and shareholders, paid within 30 days, and unpaid dividends must be transferred to special accounts. This ensures fairness and transparency. For companies formed by Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth, dividends are a way to reward investors like Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat, while also maintaining financial discipline.

## Q7. "Every member is shareholder of company but every shareholder is not member of company." Critically analyze the statement.  
---

**7\. "Every member is shareholder of company but every shareholder is not member of company." Critically analyze the statement.**

This statement highlights the difference between the concepts of “member” and “shareholder” in company law. At first glance, they may look similar, but legally they are not always the same. Understanding this distinction is important because rights and obligations in a company depend on whether a person is a member or just a shareholder.

**Who is a member?**  
 A member is a person whose name is entered in the Register of Members of the company. Membership arises when a person agrees to become a member and his name is recorded officially. Members have rights such as voting, attending meetings, and receiving dividends.

**Who is a shareholder?**  
 A shareholder is a person who owns shares in the company. Shareholding arises when a person buys or holds shares, but unless his name is entered in the Register of Members, he is not legally recognized as a member.

**Analysis of the statement**

1. **Every member is a shareholder**

   * When a person’s name is entered in the Register of Members, it means he owns shares in the company.  
   * Example: If Prateek buys shares of “Lucknow Traders Ltd.” and his name is entered in the Register, he becomes both a shareholder and a member.  
   * Thus, membership always implies shareholding.  
2. **Every shareholder is not a member**

   * A person may hold shares but not be entered in the Register of Members. In such cases, he is a shareholder but not a member.  
   * Example: Krishna buys shares of “Varanasi Textiles Ltd.” from Kanishth in a private transaction. Until his name is entered in the Register, Krishna is only a shareholder, not a member.  
   * Similarly, if Raghavendra holds share certificates but has not completed the registration process, he is not legally a member.  
3. **Legal distinction**

   * Membership is a legal status, while shareholding is a factual status.  
   * Shareholding gives ownership of shares, but membership gives legal recognition and rights in the company.  
4. **Cases showing distinction**

   * *Balkrishnan Gupta v. Swadeshi Polytex Ltd.* (1985) – the Supreme Court held that membership arises only when the name is entered in the Register of Members.  
   * This shows that mere possession of shares does not make one a member.  
5. **Practical implications**

   * Only members can vote in general meetings. Shareholders who are not registered cannot exercise voting rights.  
   * Example: Laukendra buys shares of “Kanpur Developers Ltd.” but his name is not yet entered in the Register. He cannot vote in the AGM, while Saurabh, whose name is registered, can vote.  
   * Similarly, only members can sue the company for rights violation.  
6. **Special cases**

   * In case of transmission of shares (like inheritance), a person becomes a shareholder immediately but becomes a member only after registration.  
   * Example: If Satyam inherits shares of “Allahabad Builders Ltd.” from his father, he is a shareholder. But he becomes a member only when his name is entered in the Register.

**Critical analysis**  
 The distinction between member and shareholder is important for corporate governance. It ensures that only those officially recognized in the Register can exercise rights. However, in practice, most shareholders are also members because companies promptly update their registers. Still, delays in registration or private transfers can create situations where shareholders are not members.

**Conclusion**  
 The statement “Every member is shareholder of company but every shareholder is not member of company” is correct. Membership requires legal recognition through entry in the Register of Members, while shareholding only requires ownership of shares. Thus, while Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat may all hold shares, only those whose names are entered in the Register are members. This distinction ensures clarity in rights, obligations, and governance of companies.

## Q8. Who is director of company? Discuss his role, functions and powers in corporate governance.  
---

**8\. Who is director of company? Discuss his role, functions and powers in corporate governance.**

A director is a person appointed to manage the affairs of a company. Under the Companies Act, 2013, directors are considered the “brain” of the company because they take decisions, frame policies, and ensure compliance with law. They act as agents, trustees, and representatives of shareholders. The Board of Directors collectively governs the company, while individual directors contribute through their expertise and judgment.

For example, if Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth form a company in Lucknow, they may appoint Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat as directors. These directors will manage the company’s day-to-day affairs, decide on investments, declare dividends, and ensure compliance with the Companies Act.

**Role of directors in corporate governance**  
 Corporate governance means the system by which companies are directed and controlled. Directors play a central role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness.

1. **Strategic decision-making**

   * Directors decide the long-term goals of the company.  
   * Example: If “Varanasi Textiles Ltd.” wants to expand into export markets, directors like Prateek and Krishna will frame the strategy.  
2. **Compliance with law**

   * Directors ensure that the company follows the Companies Act, SEBI regulations, and other laws.  
   * Example: If “Kanpur Developers Ltd.” issues shares, directors must ensure proper filing with Registrar of Companies.  
3. **Protection of shareholders’ interests**

   * Directors act as trustees of shareholders’ money. They must use funds responsibly.  
   * Example: If Laukendra invests in a company, directors must ensure his money is not misused.  
4. **Corporate governance practices**

   * Directors ensure transparency in financial reporting, fair treatment of stakeholders, and ethical conduct.  
   * Example: Saurabh, as an independent director, may insist on proper disclosure of company accounts.

**Functions of directors**

1. **Management of business**

   * Directors manage day-to-day operations and supervise employees.  
   * Example: Satyam may oversee production in “Allahabad Builders Ltd.” while Sachkeerat manages marketing.  
2. **Raising capital**

   * Directors decide how to raise funds—through shares, debentures, or loans.  
3. **Dividend declaration**

   * Directors recommend dividend distribution to shareholders.  
4. **Appointment of key managerial personnel**

   * Directors appoint CEO, CFO, and company secretary.  
5. **Policy formulation**

   * Directors frame policies on expansion, mergers, acquisitions, and corporate social responsibility (CSR).

**Powers of directors under Companies Act, 2013**

1. **General powers**

   * Section 179 gives directors power to manage company affairs, borrow money, invest funds, and approve financial statements.  
2. **Specific powers requiring Board resolution**

   * To issue debentures.  
   * To borrow beyond paid-up capital.  
   * To approve mergers or amalgamations.  
3. **Powers delegated to committees**

   * Audit committee, remuneration committee, CSR committee—all function under directors’ supervision.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Suppose “Lucknow Traders Ltd.” wants to expand into real estate. Directors like Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth meet in a Board meeting. They decide strategy, approve investment, and ensure compliance with law. Raghavendra and Laukendra supervise financial reporting, while Saurabh as independent director ensures transparency. Satyam and Sachkeerat oversee operations. This shows how directors collectively govern the company.

**Critical analysis**  
 Directors are powerful, but their powers must be balanced with accountability. Misuse of power can harm shareholders and society. Therefore, corporate governance requires independent directors, audit committees, and disclosure norms. This ensures directors act in the best interest of the company and stakeholders.

**Conclusion**  
 A director is the key managerial person who governs the company. His role includes strategic decision-making, compliance, protection of shareholders, and ensuring corporate governance. His functions include managing business, raising capital, declaring dividends, and appointing key personnel. His powers are wide but regulated under the Companies Act, 2013\. For companies formed by Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat, directors ensure that corporate governance is maintained with transparency and accountability.

**9\. "Corporate governance ensures transparency and accountability." Analyze the statement in light of powers, functions and role of independent director.**

Corporate governance refers to the system by which companies are directed and controlled. It ensures that companies are managed in a fair, transparent, and accountable manner. The aim is to protect the interests of shareholders, employees, creditors, and society at large. One of the most important features of modern corporate governance is the role of independent directors.

Independent directors are members of the Board who are not involved in the day-to-day management of the company. They are appointed to bring objectivity, fairness, and independent judgment to Board decisions. Their presence ensures that the company is not run only for the benefit of promoters or majority shareholders, but for all stakeholders.

**Transparency in corporate governance**  
 Transparency means clear disclosure of financial information, policies, and decisions. Independent directors play a key role in ensuring transparency.

* Example: If Prateek and Krishna are promoters of “Lucknow Traders Ltd.”, they may want to hide losses. But independent directors like Kanishth or Raghavendra can insist on proper disclosure in financial statements.  
* This builds trust among shareholders like Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat.

**Accountability in corporate governance**  
 Accountability means that directors and managers are answerable for their actions. Independent directors ensure accountability by questioning decisions and monitoring performance.

* Example: If “Varanasi Textiles Ltd.” wants to invest in risky projects, independent directors can ask whether it benefits shareholders or only promoters.  
* This prevents misuse of company funds and ensures directors act responsibly.

**Powers of independent directors under Companies Act, 2013**

1. **Attend Board meetings** – Independent directors participate in Board meetings and give unbiased opinions.  
2. **Audit committee role** – They are part of audit committees that oversee financial reporting and internal controls.  
3. **Remuneration committee role** – They decide fair salaries for directors and key managerial personnel.  
4. **CSR committee role** – They ensure that corporate social responsibility funds are used properly.  
5. **Protection of minority shareholders** – They safeguard the interests of small investors who may otherwise be ignored.

**Functions of independent directors**

1. **Monitoring management** – They supervise the actions of executive directors and managers.  
2. **Ensuring compliance** – They check whether the company follows laws and regulations.  
3. **Risk management** – They evaluate risks in projects and investments.  
4. **Conflict resolution** – They resolve conflicts between majority and minority shareholders.  
5. **Ethical standards** – They promote ethical conduct in business.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Suppose “Kanpur Developers Ltd.” is controlled by promoters Prateek and Krishna. They want to give contracts to their relatives at inflated prices. Independent directors like Kanishth and Raghavendra object, saying this is against shareholders’ interest. They demand transparency in tender process. As a result, contracts are given fairly, protecting shareholders like Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat. This shows how independent directors ensure transparency and accountability.

**Case law reference**  
 In *Tata Consultancy Services v. Cyrus Mistry* (2017), issues of corporate governance and role of independent directors were highlighted. The case showed how independent directors can question management decisions and protect minority shareholders.

**Critical analysis**  
 Independent directors are essential for good corporate governance. They bring impartiality and protect stakeholders. However, critics argue that sometimes independent directors are not truly independent, as they may be influenced by promoters. Therefore, their effectiveness depends on their integrity and willingness to act.

**Conclusion**  
 Corporate governance ensures transparency and accountability by involving independent directors in decision-making. Their powers and functions include monitoring management, ensuring compliance, protecting minority shareholders, and promoting ethical standards. For companies formed by Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat, independent directors act as watchdogs, ensuring that the company is run fairly and responsibly. Thus, independent directors are the backbone of transparency and accountability in modern corporate governance.

## Q10. What is related party transaction? Discuss with relevant provisions and cases.

**10\. What is related party transaction? Discuss with relevant provisions and cases.**

A related party transaction (RPT) means a transaction between a company and persons or entities that are closely connected to it. These include directors, key managerial personnel, relatives of directors, or other companies in which directors have significant interest. The idea is that such transactions may not always be at arm’s length and could be used to benefit insiders at the cost of shareholders. Therefore, the Companies Act, 2013 lays down strict rules to regulate related party transactions.

**Meaning of related party**  
 Section 2(76) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines “related party.” It includes:

* Directors and their relatives.  
* Key managerial personnel and their relatives.  
* Firms or private companies in which directors are partners or members.  
* Public companies where directors hold significant shares.  
* Subsidiary, holding, or associate companies.

For example, if Prateek is a director of “Lucknow Traders Ltd.” and his brother Krishna owns a firm in Varanasi, any contract between Lucknow Traders Ltd. and Krishna’s firm will be a related party transaction.

**Examples of related party transactions**

1. Sale or purchase of goods.  
2. Leasing of property.  
3. Providing or receiving services.  
4. Transfer of resources or obligations.  
5. Appointment of relatives to office or place of profit.

**Provisions under Companies Act, 2013 (Section 188\)**

1. **Board approval** – Related party transactions must be approved by the Board of Directors.  
2. **Shareholders’ approval** – If transactions exceed prescribed limits (like 10% of turnover or net worth), approval of shareholders by special resolution is required.  
3. **Disclosure** – Directors must disclose their interest in related party transactions.  
4. **Arm’s length principle** – Transactions must be at arm’s length, meaning they should be conducted as if between unrelated parties.  
5. **Restriction on voting** – Related parties cannot vote on resolutions approving related party transactions.

**Case laws on related party transactions**

1. *Tata Consultancy Services v. Cyrus Mistry* (2017) – highlighted concerns about related party dealings and corporate governance.  
2. *GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd.* case – SEBI emphasized disclosure of related party transactions to protect minority shareholders.  
3. *LIC v. Escorts Ltd.* (1986) – though not directly about RPT, it emphasized transparency in dealings involving connected parties.

**Practical example for clarity**  
 Suppose “Kanpur Developers Ltd.” has directors Prateek and Krishna. Krishna owns a construction firm in Allahabad. The company decides to give a contract to Krishna’s firm. This is a related party transaction. To ensure fairness, the Board must approve it, Krishna must disclose his interest, and if the contract exceeds limits, shareholders like Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat must approve it by special resolution. This prevents misuse of company funds and protects minority shareholders.

**Critical analysis**  
 Related party transactions are not always bad. Sometimes they are necessary, especially in group companies or family businesses. For example, subsidiaries often transact with holding companies. However, the risk is that insiders may misuse their position to benefit themselves. Therefore, law requires disclosure, approval, and fairness. Independent directors also play a role in monitoring such transactions.

**Conclusion**  
 Related party transactions are dealings between a company and persons closely connected to it, such as directors, relatives, or associated companies. Section 188 of the Companies Act, 2013 regulates these transactions by requiring Board and shareholder approval, disclosure, and arm’s length principle. Cases like *Tata Consultancy Services v. Cyrus Mistry* highlight the importance of transparency. For companies formed by Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat, related party transactions must be carefully monitored to ensure fairness and protect minority shareholders. Thus, regulation of RPTs is essential for good corporate governance.
