### Important Concepts 

| Concept | Section (CPC) | Simple Meaning | Easy Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Res Sub Judice** (stay of Suit) | Section 10 | A court will not try a case if the same matter is already pending in another court. | Prateek files a property case against Krishna in a Bhopal court. While it is still pending, Krishna files the same case in Indore. The Indore court will stop the case due to **res sub judice**. |
| **Res Judicata** | Section 11 | A matter once finally decided by a court cannot be filed again between the same parties. | A Delhi court decides a land dispute between Kanishth and Raghavendra. Later, Kanishth files the same case again in Jaipur. The court will reject it due to **res judicata**. |
| **Bar to Further Suit** | Section 12 | When a plaintiff is barred from filing another suit on the same cause of action. | Satyam sues Laukendra for shop rent in Delhi. After losing, he cannot file another suit for the same rent again. This is a **bar to further suit**. |
| **Caveat** | Section 148A | A notice given to the court to hear a person before passing any order. **In other words**, a person requests the court to hear them before passing any order. | Sachkeerat expects Prateek to file a case against him in Mumbai. Sachkeerat files a **caveat** so the court hears him before passing any order. |
| **Inherent Powers of Court** | Section 151 | Court has power to act for justice even if it is not mentioned in the CPC. | There is no clear rule for a situation in a case between Laukendra and Krishna in Pune. The court uses its **inherent powers** to pass a fair order. |

| **Purpose** | To avoid parallel proceedings | To give finality to court decisions |

| **Condition** | Same matter, same parties, same issue | Same matter, same parties, same issue decided earlier |
| **Nature** | Temporary bar | Permanent bar |

| **Court Action** | Court stays the later suit | Court dismisses the new suit |

1️⃣ **Res Sub Judice – Section 10**

**Mnemonic:**

👉 “SUB \= Still Under Business”

* **SUB** sounds like **Sub Judice**

* **Still Under Business** \= case is **still pending**

2️⃣ **Res Judicata – Section 11**

**Mnemonic:**

👉 “JUDGED \= Judicata”

* **Judged** \= already decided

* So it **cannot be filed again**

# PYQs (answers)

# 2024

## Q1. "Affidavit is the integral part of the institution of suits." Elaborate provisions related to affidavit and institution of suit said in the above statement.

The **institution of a suit** is the formal act of commencing a civil legal proceeding in a competent court of law.

An **Affidavit** is a formal, voluntary, written statement of facts made by a person, known as the **deponent** or **affiant**, who swears or affirms that the contents are true.

**Affidavit as an Integral Part of Institution of Suits**

Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC) lays down the rules for filing and conducting civil cases in India. One important requirement in the institution of suits is the use of **affidavits**. An affidavit is a written statement made under oath. It is signed by the person making it and verified before an authorized officer. The purpose of an affidavit is to place facts before the court in a reliable manner.

The statement “Affidavit is the integral part of the institution of suits” means that affidavits play a central role in starting and supporting a civil case. Without affidavits, the court may not have proper evidence to proceed at the initial stage.

---

**Provisions Related to Institution of Suit**

1. **Section 26 CPC** – A suit is instituted by presenting a plaint to the court.  
   * A plaint is the written document in which the plaintiff states his claim.  
   * Example: *Krishna* files a plaint in Allahabad court claiming that *Prateek* has illegally occupied his land in Lucknow.  
2. **Order IV CPC (Institution of Suits)** – Explains how a suit begins. The plaint must be filed, and the court registers the case.  
   * Example: *Satyam* files a plaint in Varanasi court against *Laukendra* for recovery of money. The court registers the suit after checking the plaint.  
3. **Order VI CPC (Pleadings Generally)** – Pleadings must contain material facts. They should be clear and not vague.  
   * Example: *Sachkeerat* files a plaint stating that *Raghavendra* borrowed ₹50,000 and did not return. He must mention dates and facts clearly.  
4. **Order VII CPC (Plaint)** – Deals with plaint. It requires details like name of parties, cause of action, relief claimed, and verification.  
5. **Order VIII CPC (Written Statement)** – Deals with written statement. The defendant replies to the plaint.

Thus, institution of suit means filing a plaint with proper pleadings, supported by documents and affidavits.

>**💡 Tip:** **Pleadings** refers to the formal written statements filed in court by the parties—the **Plaint** by the plaintiff and the **Written Statement** by the defendant.

**Order VI, Rule 2(1)** explicitly states: "Every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a concise form of the **material facts** on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved."

**What are Material Facts?**

* **Material Facts** are the primary, essential, and basic facts that must be proved by a party to establish their **cause of action** (for the plaintiff) or their **defence** (for the defendant).  
* They are the facts that give the party the **right to the relief** they seek.  
* The legal term for material facts is ***Facta Probanda*** (facts that need to be proved).

**Example:** If a plaintiff, **A**, files a suit against a defendant, **B**, for a **breach of contract**, the **material facts** that **A** must plead would include:

1. Existence of a valid contract between **A** and **B** (e.g., date and place the contract was signed).  
2. The specific terms of the contract.  
3. The specific act or omission by **B** that constituted the breach.  
4. The fact that **A** suffered a loss or injury due to the breach.

If **A** omits a single material fact, like the existence of the contract itself, the pleading may be considered defective, leading to the suit's dismissal as an **incomplete cause of action**.

**Material Facts vs. Evidence**

The rule strictly mandates that pleadings must contain **material facts** but **not the evidence** by which they are to be proved.

* **Evidence** is the means by which the material facts are proved.  
* The legal term for evidence is ***Facta Probantia*** (facts proving the facts).

**Example:** In the contract breach suit:

* **Material Fact (Facta Probanda):** The defendant **B** failed to deliver the 100 bags of cement on the agreed date of 1st July 2025\.  
* **Evidence (Facta Probantia) \- NOT to be included in the Plaint:** The email correspondence sent on 2nd July 2025 where **A** asked **B** about the non-delivery, and the testimony of the delivery truck driver who witnessed the non-delivery.

The *pleading* must only state the failure to deliver (the material fact); the *trial* is where the email and the witness testimony (the evidence) are presented to prove that fact.

The **Particulars of a Plaint** are the specific, mandatory details that a plaintiff must include in the document, as primarily governed by **Order VII, Rule 1** of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).

These particulars ensure the court has all necessary information to proceed and include:

1. **Court and Parties:** The **name of the Court** where the suit is brought, and the **name, description, and place of residence** of both the plaintiff and the defendant.  
2. **Cause of Action:** The **facts** that constitute the **cause of action** (the legal reason for the suit) and **when** that cause of action arose.  
3. **Jurisdiction:** The facts showing that the Court has the **territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction** to hear the matter.  
4. **Relief:** The **specific relief** (remedy) that the plaintiff claims (e.g., money recovery, injunction, possession).  
5. **Valuation:** A statement of the **value of the subject-matter** of the suit for the purposes of court fees and jurisdiction.  
6. **Disability (if applicable):** A statement if the plaintiff or defendant is a **minor** or a person of **unsound mind**.  
7. **Relinquishment (if applicable):** Any amount the plaintiff has **relinquished** or allowed as a set-off.

Failing to include these material particulars may lead to the rejection of the plaint.

**Provisions Related to Affidavit**

1. **Order XIX CPC** (Affidavits) – Affidavits may be used as evidence. The court can order that certain facts be proved by affidavit.

   * Example: *Saurabh* files an affidavit stating that he witnessed *Prateek* signing a contract in Kanpur.  
2. **Verification of Pleadings** – Under CPC, pleadings must be verified. This verification is often done through affidavit.

   * Example: *Kanishth* files a plaint in Delhi court. He attaches an affidavit confirming that the facts stated are true to his knowledge.  
3. **Affidavit in Interim Applications** – When parties seek temporary injunctions, stay orders, or appointment of receiver, they must file affidavits.

   * Example: *Raghavendra* seeks injunction to stop *Laukendra* from cutting trees on disputed land in Jaipur. He files an affidavit stating the facts.  
4. **Affidavit in Discovery and Production of Documents** – Parties may be asked to file affidavits about documents in their possession.

   * Example: Court asks *Sachkeerat* to file affidavit listing all sale deeds he holds.

---

**Importance of Affidavit in Institution of Suit**

* **Authenticity of Facts**: Affidavit ensures that facts stated are true. If false, the person can be punished for perjury.  
* **Speedy Justice**: Court can rely on affidavits instead of lengthy oral evidence at the initial stage.  
* **Support for Interim Reliefs**: Temporary orders like injunctions are granted on the basis of affidavits.  
* **Foundation of Suit**: Institution of suit requires plaint, and plaint must be verified. Affidavit is the tool of verification.

---

**Simple Examples**

* *Krishna* files a suit in Allahabad against *Prateek* for land. He attaches affidavit confirming facts.  
* *Satyam* sues *Laukendra* in Varanasi for recovery of loan. He files affidavit stating loan details.  
* *Sachkeerat* seeks injunction against *Raghavendra* in Jaipur. He files affidavit to support urgency.  
* *Saurabh* files affidavit in Delhi court confirming that he saw *Kanishth* sign an agreement.

---

**Conclusion**

Affidavit is not just a formality. It is a vital part of the institution of suits under CPC. Section 26 and Orders IV, VI, VII, VIII explain how suits are instituted. Order XIX explains the role of affidavits. Together, they show that affidavits give strength and authenticity to the plaint and pleadings. They help the court trust the facts at the beginning of the case.

In simple words, without affidavits, suits would lack credibility. With affidavits, suits gain legal foundation. Therefore, affidavits are truly an integral part of the institution of suits.

## Q2. "Stay of suit is incorporated in the Code with the view to stop the pendency of multiple suits in the same cause of action and the provision of bar to further suit works similar pattern also." Explain the related provisions and refer to the leading cases.

**Introduction**  
 Stay of suit and bar to further suit are important provisions in the Civil Procedure Code, 1908\. They are designed to prevent multiple suits on the same cause of action. The aim is to avoid duplication, waste of time, and conflicting judgments. These provisions protect both the parties and the court system by ensuring that one dispute is decided once and for all.

**Stay of Suit – Section 10 CPC (Res Sub Judice)**  
 Section 10 CPC provides that when a matter is already pending in one court, another court cannot proceed with a suit on the same matter between the same parties. The second suit must be stayed until the first suit is decided. This ensures that two courts do not decide the same issue at the same time.  
 *Example*: Krishna files a suit in Allahabad court against Prateek for ownership of land in Lucknow. Later, Prateek files another suit in Varanasi court against Krishna for the same land. The Varanasi suit will be stayed until the Allahabad case is decided.

**Res Judicata – Section 11 CPC**  
 Section 11 CPC says that once a matter has been finally decided between the same parties, it cannot be reopened. This is different from stay of suit because here the matter has already been decided.  
 *Example*: Krishna loses the land case in Allahabad. He cannot file another suit in Kanpur court for the same land against Prateek. The principle of res judicata bars him from doing so.

**Bar to Further Suit – Section 12 CPC**  
 Section 12 CPC prevents repeated suits on the same cause of action. The purpose is to stop harassment of the defendant and to maintain finality of litigation.  
 *Example*: Satyam sues Laukendra in Varanasi for recovery of rent and loses. He cannot file another suit again for the same rent. The law bars him from filing further suits on the same issue.

**Example: Bar to Further Suit (Section 12 read with Order II, Rule 2\)**

Let us use the names **Prateek** (Plaintiff) and **Krishna** (Defendant), and a place, **Bhopal**, for the example.

**Scenario**

**Prateek** rented his warehouse in **Bhopal** to **Krishna** for two years, from 2023 to 2025\. By the time the lease expired, **Krishna** owed **Prateek** two things due to a single cause of action (breach of the rental agreement):

1. **Recovery of Possession:** The physical return of the warehouse.  
2. **Mesne Profits (Damages):** Compensation for the illegal use of the property for six months after the lease expired (valued at ₹1,00,000).

**The Procedural Default**

1. **First Suit (2025):** **Prateek** files a suit against **Krishna** in the Bhopal Civil Court.  
2. **Omission:** In the Plaint, Prateek consciously sues **only** for the **Recovery of Possession** of the warehouse. He deliberately **omits** the claim for the **Mesne Profits** (₹1,00,000) without asking the court for permission to file a separate suit for the money later.  
3. **Result of First Suit:** The court hears the case and passes a decree ordering **Krishna** to hand over possession of the warehouse to **Prateek**.

**The Application of Section 12**

After winning the possession of the property, **Prateek** files a **Second Suit** against **Krishna** to claim the previously omitted **Mesne Profits** of ₹1,00,000.

* **The Bar:** The Bhopal Civil Court will now apply **Order II, Rule 2** (The Rule) along with **Section 12** (The Bar).  
* **Order II, Rule 2** states that since the claims for possession and mesne profits both arose from the **same cause of action** (the illegal retention of the warehouse by Krishna), and **Prateek** deliberately omitted the claim for mesne profits in the first suit **without obtaining the court’s permission (leave)**, he is barred from claiming it later.  
* **Section 12** simply confirms this procedural bar: Since **Prateek** is **precluded by the rules (Order II, Rule 2\)** from instituting a further suit for that specific monetary claim, he is **not entitled** to file the second suit.

**Conclusion:** The court will **dismiss the second suit**. **Prateek** loses his right to claim the ₹1,00,000 forever because he failed to include his entire claim in the initial pleading or seek the court's permission to split the claims. Section 12 acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring litigants are diligent and do not harass opponents with fragmented, multiple lawsuits arising from the same core dispute.

**Leading Cases**

* *Satyadhyan Ghosal v. Deorajin Debi (AIR 1960 SC 941\)*: The Supreme Court explained res judicata. It said that once a matter is decided, it cannot be reopened even in the same proceedings. This case shows the importance of finality in litigation.  
* *National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences v. C. Parameshwara (2005)*: The Supreme Court explained Section 10 CPC. It said that the object of Section 10 is to prevent courts of concurrent jurisdiction from simultaneously trying two parallel suits. This avoids conflicting decisions.  
* *Forward Construction Co. v. Prabhat Mandal (AIR 1986 SC 391\)*: The Supreme Court explained that res judicata applies not only to issues actually decided but also to issues that could have been raised. This prevents parties from splitting their claims and filing multiple suits.

**Difference Between Stay of Suit and Bar to Further Suit**  
 Stay of suit applies when two suits are pending at the same time. Bar to further suit applies when one suit has already been decided and another is attempted. Both provisions work to prevent duplication and harassment.

The difference between **Bar to Further Suit** (primarily **Section 12 CPC**) and **Res Judicata** (**Section 11 CPC**) lies in the **basis of the bar**—whether it is due to a final decision on the *merits* or a final decision based on a *procedural default*.

>**Tip 🎉**
Bar to further suit focuses on the **Cause of Action**—it prohibits splitting the same cause of action into multiple suits.
Res Judicata focuses on the **Issue** or **Matter**—it prohibits re-agitating an issue already adjudicated.

**Conclusion**  
 Stay of suit under Section 10 CPC, res judicata under Section 11 CPC, and bar to further suit under Section 12 CPC are essential provisions. They stop multiple suits on the same cause of action. They ensure finality of litigation and prevent conflicting judgments. Leading cases like *Satyadhyan Ghosal*, *National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences*, and *Forward Construction Co.* have explained these principles. 

>**In simple words**, once a matter is pending in one court, another court must wait, and once a matter is decided, it cannot be reopened. These rules save time, reduce harassment, and uphold justice.

## Q3. Discuss the Rules 1 to 7 of the parties to suits of Order-I of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Order I (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 deals with the parties to a suit. **Rules 1 to 7 explain who can be joined as plaintiffs or defendants** and how misjoinder or non-joinder of parties is treated. These rules aim to avoid multiple suits and ensure complete and effective adjudication of disputes.

**Rule 1 of Order I (1) explains who may be joined as plaintiffs.** All persons may be joined as plaintiffs in one suit if the right to relief arises out of the same act or transaction, or series of acts or transactions, and if common questions of law or fact arise. 

For example, Prateek, Kanishth, and Saurabh jointly purchase land in Jaipur. Krishna illegally occupies the land. All three owners can jointly file one suit as plaintiffs against Krishna because their right arises from the same transaction and common facts.

**Rule 2 of Order I (1) gives power to the court to order separate trials.** Even when several plaintiffs are joined, the court may order separate trials if it feels that joint trial may cause inconvenience or confusion. 

For example, Prateek and Raghavendra file a joint suit in Delhi against Krishna and Satyam, but their claims are slightly different. The court may order separate trials to ensure fairness.

**Rule 3 of Order I (1) deals with who may be joined as defendants.** All people can be made defendants in one case if:

1. The relief (remedy) asked against them comes from the same act or transaction, and  
2. The case involves common questions of law or fact for all of them.

**Example for clarity:**  

Suppose Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth together sell defective goods in Lucknow. Raghavendra sues them for compensation. Since the claim arises from the same transaction (sale of goods) and the legal question (defective goods liability) is common, all three can be joined as defendants in one case.

**Rule 4 of Order I (1) clarifies that judgment may be given without amendment.** If the court finds that the relief is available against one or more defendants, it can pass a decree against them even if all defendants are not liable. 

😀 Example: 

**Scenario**

1. **Prateek** orders 50 custom-printed t-shirts from **Krishna's** printing shop in Pune.  
2. **Saurabh** is the person Krishna hired to deliver the shirts.  
3. The t-shirts arrive late and are incorrectly printed, causing **Prateek** a financial loss of ₹20,000.  
4. **Prateek** is uncertain whether the delay and mistake were due to **Krishna** (printing shop's fault) or **Saurabh** (delivery person's mistake/delay).  
5. To cover all bases (using Order I, Rule 7), **Prateek** files a single suit against **both Krishna and Saurabh** for the ₹20,000 loss.

**Application of Order I, Rule 4(1)**

1. **Trial Outcome:** During the trial, evidence is presented.  
   * The court finds that **Krishna** printed the shirts correctly and on time, but the delay was caused solely because **Saurabh** mishandled the delivery and delivered the wrong batch to the wrong place first.  
   * The court determines that **Krishna is NOT liable**, but **Saurabh IS liable** for the ₹20,000 loss.  
2. **Judgment:** The court, applying **Order I, Rule 4(1)**, does the following:  
   * It **dismisses the suit** against **Krishna**.  
   * It passes a **decree** (judgment) ordering **Saurabh** to pay **Prateek** the ₹20,000 in damages.

**Conclusion:** The key point is that the court did **not** have to throw out the entire suit just because Krishna was wrongly included. The rule allows the court to efficiently deliver justice by passing judgment against the **one person found liable** (**Saurabh**), even though another person (**Krishna**) was included in the same initial suit.

**Rule 5 of Order I (1) states that it is not necessary that every defendant be interested in all reliefs.** A defendant can be concerned with only part of the relief claimed. In other words, In one suit, there may be several defendants and several reliefs. It is not necessary that every defendant must be connected to all the reliefs. A defendant can be concerned with only some of them.

**Example-1**, in a suit filed by Laukendra in Kanpur, Krishna may be liable for money recovery, while Saurabh may be liable only for possession. Both can still be defendants in the same suit.

**Example-2:**

* There are 3 defendants.  
* There are 3 reliefs in total.  
* Defendant 1 (say Krishna) may be liable for all 3 reliefs.  
* Defendant 2 (say Saurabh) may be liable for only 2 reliefs.  
* Defendant 3 (say Laukendra) may be liable for only 1 relief.

Still, all three can be joined together in the same suit because the case arises out of the same transaction and involves common questions of law or fact.

**Super simple analogy:**

Think of it like one cricket match where three players commit different fouls:

* One player breaks all three rules,  
* Another breaks two rules,

The third breaks only one rule.

* Even though their faults are different, they are all part of the same match — so they can be dealt with together.

**Rule 6 of Order I (1) allows the plaintiff to join alternative defendants.** When there is doubt as to who is liable, the plaintiff may join two or more defendants in the alternative. 

For example, Prateek is unsure whether Krishna or Raghavendra received his payment in a business deal in Mumbai. He can sue both in the alternative, and the court will decide who is actually liable.

**Meaning of “alternative” in this context:** “Alternative” means *either one or the other, but not both together*. When the plaintiff is not sure which defendant is actually responsible, he can include both as defendants in the same suit. The court will then decide which one is liable.

>👉 So, “alternative” here simply means **when there is doubt, you can sue multiple people, and the court will choose the correct one who is responsible.**

**Rule 7 of Order I (1) deals with suits where the plaintiff is in doubt about the person from whom relief should be claimed.** It allows the court to decide the rights and liabilities of parties when such doubt exists. 

For example, Satyam is unsure whether Prateek or Kanishth is the owner of a shop in Lucknow. The court can decide the issue in one suit. So here, Satyam is in doubt that “should he claim relief from Prateek or should he claim relief from Kanishtha?”

**In conclusion,** 

**Rules 1 to 7 of Order I (1) CPC provide a flexible and practical framework for joinder of parties to a suit.** These rules help in avoiding multiplicity of litigation, saving time and cost, and ensuring complete justice. By allowing multiple plaintiffs or defendants to be joined where common questions arise, and by giving discretion to courts to manage trials effectively, Order I (1) plays a vital role in efficient civil procedure.

## Q4 (i) A, B and C jointly pass a promissory note to D at Lucknow. A resides in Sitapur, B in Barabanki, C in Shahjahanpur and D in Kanpur. On failure of such note where D will file the suit, to be under the rule of leave of the Civil or acquiesce of the parties.

A promissory note is a written promise to pay money. When A, B, and C jointly pass a promissory note to D at Lucknow, they are jointly liable to pay him. If they fail, D has the right to file a suit for recovery. The question is: where should D file the suit?

According to the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), a suit can be filed where the cause of action arises or where the defendants reside. In this case, the promissory note was executed at Lucknow, so the cause of action arose there. Therefore, D can file the suit in Lucknow.

But since A lives in Sitapur, B in Barabanki, and C in Shahjahanpur, D may also file the suit in any of those places. However, if he wants to sue all three together, he must file in a place where all defendants can be joined. For this, he needs either:

* Leave of the court (permission of Civil Court), or  
* Acquiescence (agreement) of the defendants.

**Example:** Suppose Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth jointly sign a promissory note in Lucknow for Raghavendra. Later they fail to pay. Raghavendra can file the suit in Lucknow, because the note was made there. If he wants to file in Sitapur, he must get permission of the court or agreement of all defendants.

**Conclusion:** D can file the suit in Lucknow, where the promissory note was executed. Alternatively, he can file in Sitapur, Barabanki, or Shahjahanpur, but only with leave of the court or acquiescence of the parties.

## Q4 (ii) C is an immovable property disputed between A and B. But it is not certain that it is located in Lucknow or Sitapur. A wants to bring suit against B. Suggest the proper Court and procedure.

When immovable property is disputed, the CPC provides that the suit must be filed in the court where the property is situated. This is because immovable property is tied to a location, and only the court of that area has jurisdiction.

In this case, the property is disputed between A and B, but it is not certain whether it is in Lucknow or Sitapur. When there is uncertainty about the location, CPC allows the plaintiff to file the suit in any court where part of the property may be situated.

**Example:** Suppose Krishna and Laukendra dispute ownership of a house. Krishna is not sure whether the house falls under Lucknow jurisdiction or Sitapur jurisdiction. Krishna can file the suit in either Lucknow or Sitapur court. The court will then decide jurisdiction based on evidence.

The procedure is that A must file the plaint in one of the courts (Lucknow or Sitapur), describing the property and explaining the uncertainty. The court will examine documents, maps, and witness evidence to determine jurisdiction. If necessary, the case may be transferred to the proper court.

**Conclusion:** When immovable property is disputed and its location is uncertain, the plaintiff can file the suit in any court where the property may be situated. In this case, A can file in Lucknow or Sitapur. The court will then decide jurisdiction after examining evidence.

## Q5. Answer the following:

1. Particulars of interrogatories to be submitted and form of interrogations  
2. Inspection of documents referred in pleadings or affidavit

### 5 (a) Particulars of interrogatories to be submitted and form of interrogations

Interrogatories are written questions that one party in a civil suit sends to the other party, asking for information or facts. They are used to save time and narrow down issues before trial. The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) allows interrogatories under Order XI.

**Particulars to be submitted:**

* The party must apply to the court for permission to deliver interrogatories.  
* The application must include the exact questions to be asked.  
* The questions must relate to matters in issue in the suit.  
* They cannot be vague, irrelevant, or scandalous.  
* The court will check and approve only those questions that are necessary for justice.

**Form of interrogations:**

* Interrogatories are submitted in writing.  
* They are numbered consecutively.  
* They must be answered on oath by the opposite party.  
* Answers can be “Yes,” “No,” or detailed explanations.

**Example:** Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow for recovery of money. Prateek may send interrogatories asking:

1. Did you receive ₹50,000 from me on 10th June?  
2. Did you sign the receipt?  
    Krishna must answer truthfully.

**Conclusion:** Interrogatories are a tool to discover facts before trial. They must be submitted with particulars, in proper form, and approved by the court. This ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary delay.

---

### 5 (b) Inspection of documents referred in pleadings or affidavit

Inspection of documents means the right of a party to see and check the documents referred to by the other party in pleadings or affidavits. This helps both sides prepare their case properly.

**Rules under CPC:**

* If a party refers to a document in pleadings or affidavit, the other party has the right to inspect it.  
* The party must apply to the court for inspection.  
* The court may order the party holding the document to produce it for inspection.  
* Copies can also be taken.

**Example:** Suppose Kanishth files a suit in Kanpur against Raghavendra and mentions a contract in his plaint. Raghavendra can apply for inspection of that contract. Similarly, if Laukendra files an affidavit referring to a receipt, Saurabh can demand inspection of that receipt.

**Importance:**

* Ensures transparency.  
* Prevents surprise at trial.  
* Helps parties prepare evidence.

**Conclusion:** Inspection of documents referred in pleadings or affidavits is a right of the opposite party. It ensures fairness, transparency, and proper preparation for trial.

## Q6. Discuss the powers and procedures of Civil Court to pass interlocutory orders.

**6\. Discuss the powers and procedures of Civil Court to pass interlocutory orders.**

Interlocutory orders are temporary orders passed by a Civil Court during the pendency of a suit. They are not final judgments but are meant to preserve rights, maintain balance, and prevent injustice until the case is finally decided. The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) gives Civil Courts wide powers to pass such orders.

**Meaning of interlocutory orders**  

These are orders passed in the middle of a case to ensure that the subject matter of the suit is protected and justice is not defeated. They are like temporary safeguards.

**Examples of interlocutory orders**

1. Granting temporary injunctions.  
2. Appointing a receiver.  
3. Ordering attachment before judgment.  
4. Granting interim maintenance.  
5. Passing orders for production or inspection of documents.

**Powers of Civil Court to pass interlocutory orders**

1. **Temporary injunctions (Order XXXIX CPC)**  
   * The court can restrain a party from doing something that may harm the subject matter of the suit.  
   * Example: If Prateek files a suit in Lucknow against Krishna to stop him from selling disputed land, the court can pass an injunction order preventing Krishna from selling until the case is decided.  
2. **Appointment of receiver (Order XL CPC)**  
   * The court can appoint a neutral person (receiver) to manage property during the case.  
   * Example: If Kanishth and Raghavendra dispute ownership of a shop in Kanpur, the court may appoint a receiver to manage the shop until the case is resolved.  
3. **Attachment before judgment (Order XXXVIII CPC)**  
   * The court can attach property of the defendant before judgment if there is a risk that he may dispose of it to defeat the claim.  
   * Example: If Laukendra sues Saurabh in Allahabad for recovery of money, and Saurabh is trying to sell his house to avoid payment, the court can attach the house before judgment.  
4. **Interim maintenance and custody (Order XXXII CPC)**  
   * In family disputes, the court can order interim maintenance or custody arrangements.  
   * Example: If Satyam files a case in Varanasi for custody of his child, the court may pass an interim order granting temporary custody until final judgment.  
5. **Production and inspection of documents (Order XI CPC)**  
   * The court can order parties to produce documents or allow inspection.  
   * Example: If Sachkeerat sues Krishna in Barabanki and refers to a contract, the court can order Krishna to produce the contract for inspection.

**Procedure for passing interlocutory orders**

1. **Application by party** – The party must file an application supported by affidavit explaining why the order is needed.  
2. **Notice to opposite party** – Generally, the court issues notice to the other party before passing the order.  
3. **Hearing both sides** – The court hears arguments of both parties.  
4. **Prima facie case** – The court checks whether there is a strong case in favor of the applicant.  
5. **Balance of convenience** – The court considers which side will suffer more harm if the order is not passed.  
6. **Irreparable injury** – The court ensures that without the order, the applicant may suffer harm that cannot be compensated later.  
7. **Passing the order** – The court passes the interlocutory order, which remains in force until the final judgment.

**Practical example for clarity**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow claiming ownership of land. Krishna is about to sell the land to Kanishth. Prateek applies for a temporary injunction. The court finds that Prateek has a prima facie case, balance of convenience is in his favor, and he may suffer irreparable loss if land is sold. The court passes an interlocutory order restraining Krishna from selling the land until the case is decided.

**Critical analysis**  

Interlocutory orders are necessary to prevent injustice during the pendency of suits. They protect property, rights, and interests of parties. However, misuse of such orders can delay justice. Courts must balance fairness and efficiency while granting them.

**Conclusion**  

Civil Courts have wide powers under CPC to pass interlocutory orders like injunctions, appointment of receivers, attachment before judgment, interim maintenance, and inspection of documents. The procedure involves application, notice, hearing, and satisfaction of conditions like prima facie case, balance of convenience, and irreparable injury. For disputes involving Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat in places like Lucknow, Kanpur, and Allahabad, interlocutory orders act as safeguards to ensure justice is not defeated before final judgment.

## Q7. Explain the Rules 5 to 9 of attachment before judgement. Can agricultural produce be attachable? Which Court is not competent to attach immovable property?

**7\. Explain the Rules 5 to 9 of attachment before judgment. Can agricultural produce be attachable? Which Court is not competent to attach immovable property?**

**Attachment before judgment** is a safeguard provided under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). It means that before the final judgment is passed, the court can order attachment (seizure or securing) of the defendant’s property if there is a risk that the defendant may dispose of it to defeat the claim of the plaintiff. This ensures that the plaintiff’s rights are protected and the decree, if passed, can be executed properly.

**Rules 5 to 9 of Order XXXVIII CPC**

**Rule 5 – When defendant may be called upon to furnish security**

* If the court believes that the defendant is about to dispose of or remove property to defeat the plaintiff’s claim, it may order the defendant to furnish security.  
* Example: If Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow for recovery of ₹5 lakh, and Krishna is trying to sell his house in Barabanki to avoid payment, the court can order Krishna to give security for the amount.

**Rule 6 – Attachment of property**

* If the defendant fails to furnish security, the court may order attachment of his property.  
* Example: If Kanishth refuses to give security in a suit filed by Raghavendra in Kanpur, the court can attach his shop so that it cannot be sold until the case is decided.

**Rule 7 – Mode of attachment**

* The court must follow proper procedure for attachment. For immovable property, it may include affixing an order on the property or at the courthouse. For movable property, it may involve actual seizure.  
* Example: If Laukendra’s land in Allahabad is attached, the court will put a notice on the land and record it officially.

**Rule 8 – Adjudication of claim to property**

* If someone else claims rights over the attached property, the court will investigate.  
* Example: If Saurabh’s car is attached in a suit filed by Satyam, but Sachkeerat claims ownership of the car, the court will examine documents and decide who is the real owner.

**Rule 9 – Removal of attachment**

* If the defendant furnishes security later or if the suit is dismissed, the attachment is removed.  
* Example: If Krishna later deposits money in court, the attachment of his house will be lifted.

**Can agricultural produce be attachable?**  

Yes, agricultural produce can be attached before judgment. However, the court must ensure that such attachment does not cause unnecessary hardship to farmers. For example, if Prateek sues Kanishth in Lucknow and Kanishth tries to sell his harvested wheat to avoid payment, the court can attach the wheat.

**Which Court is not competent to attach immovable property?**  

A court that does not have jurisdiction over the location of the immovable property cannot attach it. Only the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the property is situated has the power.

* Example: If Krishna’s land is in Sitapur, the Lucknow court cannot attach it. Only the Sitapur court has jurisdiction.

**Practical example for clarity**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow for recovery of ₹10 lakh. Krishna owns land in Sitapur and is trying to sell it quickly. The Lucknow court can order Krishna to furnish security. If he fails, the Sitapur court (which has jurisdiction over the land) will attach the property. If Krishna later deposits money, the attachment will be removed.

**Critical analysis**  

Attachment before judgment is a powerful tool to prevent defendants from defeating justice. But it must be used carefully, because wrongful attachment can harm innocent parties. Courts must balance the plaintiff’s rights with fairness to the defendant.

**Conclusion**  

Rules 5 to 9 of Order XXXVIII CPC provide the procedure for attachment before judgment: calling for security, attachment of property, mode of attachment, adjudication of claims, and removal of attachment. Agricultural produce can be attached, but only with care. A court not having territorial jurisdiction cannot attach immovable property. For disputes involving Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat, these rules ensure that justice is not defeated by dishonest disposal of property.

## Q8. Discuss the following provisions:

(a) Framing of issue and Court pronounce judgement on all issues  
(b) Materials from which issues may be framed and Court may execute witness and documents before framing.

### 8 (a) Framing of issue and Court pronounce judgement on all issues

**Framing of issues** means identifying the exact points of dispute between the parties in a case. The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) requires the court to frame issues after reading the pleadings (plaint and written statement). Issues are framed so that the trial focuses only on the real disputes.

Types of issues:

1. **Issues of fact** – relating to facts (e.g., whether Krishna received money from Prateek).  
2. **Issues of law** – relating to legal questions (e.g., whether the contract is valid under law).

**Procedure:**

* The court reads pleadings.  
* Examines documents.  
* Asks parties to clarify disputes.  
* Frames issues in clear language.

**Judgment on all issues:**  

The court must pronounce judgment on all issues framed, not just one. This ensures complete justice.

**Example:** Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow for recovery of ₹1 lakh. Krishna denies receiving money and also claims the suit is time-barred. The court frames two issues:

1. Did Krishna receive ₹1 lakh from Prateek?

Is the suit barred by limitation?

2. The court must give judgment on both issues, not just one.

**Conclusion:** Framing of issues focuses the trial on real disputes. The court must pronounce judgment on all issues to ensure complete justice.

### 8 (b) Materials from which issues may be framed and Court may examine witness and documents before framing

The CPC provides that issues are framed from materials available in pleadings, documents, and statements of parties.

**Materials for framing issues:**

1. **Pleadings** – plaint and written statement.  
2. **Documents** – contracts, receipts, property papers.  
3. **Statements of parties** – oral clarifications in court.  
4. **Admissions or denials** – what parties admit or deny.

**Court may examine witnesses and documents before framing:**

* Sometimes, pleadings are unclear.  
* The court may call witnesses or ask for documents before framing issues.  
* This ensures that issues are framed correctly.

**Example:** Suppose Kanishth sues Raghavendra in Kanpur claiming ownership of land. Raghavendra denies it. The court may ask both to produce property papers before framing issues. If needed, it may examine a witness like Laukendra who knows about the land.

**Conclusion:** Issues are framed from pleadings, documents, and statements. The court may examine witnesses and documents before framing to ensure clarity. This helps in fair trial and avoids confusion later.

## Q9. Explain the Courts and Classes of suits to which the summary procedure shall apply and what shall be contained in the institution of summary procedure.

**9\. Explain the Courts and Classes of suits to which the summary procedure shall apply and what shall be contained in the institution of summary procedure.**

**Meaning of summary procedure**  

Summary procedure is a special type of procedure under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) meant for quick disposal of certain suits. In these suits, the defendant does not have an automatic right to defend. He must first obtain permission from the court to defend. The idea is to prevent unnecessary delay in cases where liability is usually clear.

**Courts to which summary procedure applies**  

Summary procedure applies only in certain courts:

1. High Courts.  
2. City Civil Courts.  
3. Courts of Small Causes.  
4. Other courts notified by the State Government.

**Example:** If Prateek files a suit in Lucknow for recovery of money based on a promissory note, he can use summary procedure in the High Court or Small Causes Court. This ensures faster disposal.

**Classes of suits to which summary procedure applies**  

Order XXXVII of CPC provides that summary procedure applies to:

1. Suits based on bills of exchange, hundis, and promissory notes.  
2. Suits for recovery of debt or liquidated demand in money arising from written contracts, enactments, or guarantees.

**Example:**

* Krishna signs a promissory note in Kanpur promising to pay ₹1 lakh to Kanishth. If he fails, Kanishth can file a summary suit.  
* Raghavendra enters into a written contract with Laukendra to supply goods worth ₹50,000. If Laukendra fails to pay, Raghavendra can file a summary suit.

**Institution of summary procedure**  

When a plaintiff files a summary suit, certain requirements must be followed:

1. **Plaint must state clearly** that the suit is under Order XXXVII CPC.  
2. **Cause of action** must be based on promissory note, bill of exchange, or written contract.  
3. **Summons to defendant** must be in a special form, requiring him to appear within 10 days.  
4. **Defendant’s right to defend** – The defendant cannot automatically file a written statement. He must apply for leave to defend.  
5. **Court’s discretion** – The court may grant leave to defend if the defendant shows a valid defense. If not, the plaintiff gets judgment immediately.

**Example:** Suppose Saurabh files a summary suit in Allahabad against Satyam for recovery of ₹2 lakh based on a written contract. The plaint mentions it is under Order XXXVII. The court issues summons to Satyam. If Satyam wants to defend, he must apply for leave to defend within 10 days. If he fails, the court will pass judgment in favor of Saurabh.

**Practical example for clarity**  

Sachkeerat lends ₹1 lakh to Krishna in Barabanki through a promissory note. Krishna fails to pay. Sachkeerat files a summary suit in the City Civil Court. The plaint mentions Order XXXVII. Krishna receives summons. He must apply for leave to defend. If he shows proof that the promissory note was forged, the court may allow him to defend. If he fails to show valid defense, the court will pass judgment quickly in favor of Sachkeerat.

**Critical analysis**  

Summary procedure is useful because it saves time in clear cases like promissory notes and written contracts. It prevents defendants from delaying justice unnecessarily. However, courts must ensure that genuine defenses are not rejected. Otherwise, it may cause injustice.

**Conclusion**  

Summary procedure under Order XXXVII CPC applies to High Courts, City Civil Courts, Courts of Small Causes, and other notified courts. It covers suits based on promissory notes, bills of exchange, hundis, and written contracts. The plaint must mention Order XXXVII, and the defendant must apply for leave to defend. For disputes involving Prateek, Krishna, Kanishth, Raghavendra, Laukendra, Saurabh, Satyam, and Sachkeerat in places like Lucknow, Kanpur, and Allahabad, summary procedure ensures quick disposal of suits where liability is clear.

## Q10. Explain the following:

1. Public nuisance and other wrongful acts against the public  
2. A was the servant of X and Y. Both displaced due to internal rebel. Z property is in the hand of A. Sons of X and Y claim on Z property. What A will do?

---

### 10 (a) Public nuisance and other wrongful acts against the public

Public nuisance means an act that causes inconvenience, harm, or danger to the public at large. It is not about injury to one person but to the community. The law treats public nuisance seriously because it affects society’s peace and safety.

Examples of public nuisance:

* Blocking a public road.  
* Polluting a river used by villagers.  
* Running a factory that spreads foul smell in a residential area.

**Illustration:** Suppose Prateek runs a chemical factory in Lucknow. The waste flows into the Gomti river, making the water unsafe for people in the city. This is a public nuisance because it harms everyone who uses the river.

Other wrongful acts against the public include:

* Obstructing public ways.  
* Keeping dangerous animals in public places.  
* Playing loud music at night disturbing the locality.

**Conclusion:** Public nuisance and wrongful acts against the public are those that harm society as a whole. The law allows authorities or even individuals (with court’s permission) to file suits to stop such acts.

---

### 10 (b) A was the servant of X and Y. Both were displaced due to internal rebel. Z property is in the hand of A. Sons of X and Y claim on Z property. What will A do?

This situation is about possession and responsibility of a servant holding property when masters are displaced.

Here, A is servant of X and Y. Due to internal rebel, both X and Y are displaced. Their property (Z property) is in A’s possession. Later, sons of X and Y claim rights over Z property.

**Legal position:**

* A is only a servant, not the owner.  
* He must not misuse or claim the property.  
* His duty is to safeguard the property until rightful ownership is decided.  
* When sons of X and Y claim, A should deliver the property to the rightful heirs.

**Example:** Suppose Krishna is servant of Raghavendra and Laukendra. They are displaced due to riots in Kanpur. Their house (Z property) is left with Krishna. Later, sons of Raghavendra and Laukendra claim the house. Krishna must hand over the house to them, as he is only custodian.

**Conclusion**: A, being servant, has no ownership rights. He must safeguard Z property and hand it over to the rightful heirs (sons of X and Y). His role is that of a trustee or custodian, not owner.

## Q1. Discuss the res judicata and constructive res judicata. What are restrictions on further suits ?

---

**1\. Discuss the res judicata and constructive res judicata. What are restrictions on further suits?**

Res judicata is a very important principle in civil procedure. It is contained in **Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC)**. The term “res judicata” is a Latin phrase which means “a matter already judged.” It prevents the same parties from filing another case on the same issue once it has been finally decided by a competent court. The idea is that litigation must come to an end, and parties should not be allowed to harass each other by filing repeated suits on the same matter.

For example, suppose **Prateek** files a suit against **Krishna** in Lucknow court claiming ownership of a house. The court hears the matter and decides that Krishna is the rightful owner. Later, Prateek again files another suit in Varanasi court against Krishna for the same house claiming ownership. Here, the second suit will be barred by res judicata because the matter has already been decided. This saves time of the court and prevents unnecessary harassment.

Constructive res judicata is a related principle. It means that if a party could have raised a particular issue in the earlier suit but did not raise it, then he cannot raise it in a later suit. In other words, issues which ought to have been raised earlier are deemed to have been decided. This is explained in **Explanation IV of Section 11 CPC**. For example, suppose **Kanishth** sues **Raghavendra** for recovery of money in Allahabad court. He claims only part of the money due. Later, he files another suit for the remaining amount which he could have claimed earlier. The second suit will be barred by constructive res judicata because he should have claimed the whole amount in the first suit.

The principle of res judicata applies when:

* The matter directly and substantially in issue has been decided.  
* The earlier decision was by a competent court.  
* The parties in both suits are the same or claim under the same title.  
* The earlier decision was final.

**Restrictions on further suits:**  
 The CPC imposes restrictions so that parties cannot file endless suits.

1. If a matter has been finally decided, no further suit can be filed on the same issue.  
2. If a party could have raised an issue earlier but failed to do so, he cannot raise it later.  
3. Even if a party changes the form of the suit or the relief claimed, the principle of res judicata will apply if the matter is substantially the same.  
4. Appeals and revisions are allowed, but once the matter reaches finality, no fresh suit is permitted.

For example, **Laukendra** files a suit against **Saurabh** in Sitapur court claiming ownership of agricultural land. The court decides against Laukendra. He then files another suit in Hardoi court claiming ownership of the same land but this time saying he inherited it from his uncle. Even though he changes the reason, the suit will be barred because the matter of ownership has already been decided.

The principle ensures that there is certainty in law. Without res judicata, disputes would never end. Courts would be flooded with repeated cases, and justice would be delayed. It also protects parties from harassment and saves judicial resources.

**Conclusion:**  
 Res judicata and constructive res judicata are essential principles of civil procedure. They prevent repeated litigation and ensure finality of judgments. Once a matter is decided, parties cannot reopen it in another suit. Constructive res judicata further prevents parties from raising issues later which they should have raised earlier. Restrictions on further suits are necessary to maintain discipline in litigation and to protect both courts and parties from endless disputes. In simple words, once the court has spoken, the matter must rest there.

## Q2 Explain the provisions of caveat.

**2\. Explain the provisions of caveat**

A caveat is a formal notice given by a person to the court that no order should be passed without hearing him. The word “caveat” literally means “beware.” It is a precautionary measure available under **Section 148A of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC)**. The purpose of a caveat is to protect the interests of a person who anticipates that another party may file a case or application against him. By lodging a caveat, he ensures that the court will not pass any order without giving him an opportunity to be heard.

**Meaning and purpose:**  
 Suppose **Prateek** fears that **Krishna** may file an application in Lucknow court to get an injunction against him regarding a piece of land. Prateek can file a caveat in that court. If Krishna files the application, the court will first inform Prateek and give him a chance to present his side before passing any order. This prevents one‑sided orders and ensures fairness.

**Who can lodge a caveat:**  
 Any person who has an interest in a matter can lodge a caveat. It may be a party to the suit or even someone who is likely to be affected by the order. For example, if **Kanishth** is a tenant in a shop in Allahabad and fears that **Raghavendra**, the landlord, may file an application to evict him, Kanishth can lodge a caveat. This way, he will be heard before any eviction order is passed.

**Procedure:**

1. A caveat must be filed in the court where the application is expected.  
2. It must contain the name of the caveator (the person filing it), the name of the opposite party, and details of the matter.  
3. Once filed, the caveat remains valid for **90 days**. If no application is filed within that period, the caveat lapses.  
4. If an application is filed during that period, the court must serve notice to the caveator.  
5. The applicant must also provide a copy of the application to the caveator.

**Rights of the caveator:**

* The caveator has the right to be heard before any order is passed.  
* He must be served with a copy of the application filed by the opposite party.  
* He can appear and argue his case when the matter is heard.

**Limitations:**

* A caveat cannot be filed in criminal matters. It is only for civil proceedings.  
* It cannot prevent the filing of a case; it only ensures that the caveator is heard before any order is passed.  
* It is valid only for 90 days unless renewed.

**Example for clarity:**  
 Suppose **Laukendra** owns agricultural land in Sitapur. He fears that **Saurabh** may file an application in court to get an injunction stopping him from cultivating the land. Laukendra files a caveat in Sitapur court. Later, Saurabh files the application. The court will inform Laukendra and give him a chance to present his side before deciding. This ensures that no unfair one‑sided order is passed.

Another example: **Satyam** deposits money in a bank in Varanasi. He fears that **Sachkeerat** may file an application claiming that money. Satyam can lodge a caveat in Varanasi court. If Sachkeerat files the application, Satyam will be heard before any order is passed.

**Importance of caveat:**  
 The caveat provision is important because it promotes natural justice. It ensures that no one is condemned unheard. It prevents ex‑parte orders (orders passed without hearing the other side). It also reduces unnecessary litigation because parties get a chance to explain before orders are passed.

**Conclusion:**  
 A caveat under Section 148A CPC is a safeguard for persons who anticipate legal action against them. It ensures that they are heard before any order is passed. The caveat remains valid for 90 days and applies only to civil matters. It is a simple but powerful tool to protect rights and prevent injustice. In short, a caveat tells the court: “Do not pass any order without hearing me.”

## Q3. Explain the following:

1. Inherent powers of the Court  
2. Mesne profits

### 3(a) Inherent powers of the Court

Inherent powers are those powers which a court has naturally, even if they are not specifically mentioned in the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). These powers are recognized under **Section 151 CPC**. The idea is that courts must have some basic authority to do justice and to prevent misuse of the legal process. Inherent powers are used when there is no specific provision in the CPC to deal with a situation, but justice requires action.

For example, suppose **Prateek** files a case against **Krishna** in Lucknow court. Later, Prateek realizes that the case was filed wrongly and wants to withdraw it. If the CPC does not provide a clear rule for that situation, the court can use its inherent power to allow withdrawal in the interest of justice.

Another example: **Kanishth** files a case against **Raghavendra** and tries to delay proceedings by filing unnecessary applications. The court can use its inherent power to stop such misuse and ensure the case proceeds fairly.

**Key uses of inherent powers:**

* To prevent abuse of the process of court.  
* To secure the ends of justice.  
* To correct mistakes or procedural irregularities.  
* To stay proceedings temporarily if justice demands.

**Limitations:**

* Inherent powers cannot override specific provisions of CPC.  
* They cannot be used to create new rights or duties.  
* They are used only when no specific rule applies.

**Conclusion:**  
 Inherent powers are like the court’s natural authority to ensure justice. They act as a safety valve to deal with unusual situations. Courts use them carefully, only when necessary, to prevent injustice and misuse of law.

### 3(b) Mesne profits

The term “mesne profits” refers to the profits or benefits that a person unlawfully in possession of property earns during the time he occupies it. It is explained in **Section 2(12) CPC**. Mesne profits are compensation given to the rightful owner for the loss suffered because someone else wrongfully enjoyed the property.

For example, suppose **Laukendra** owns agricultural land in Sitapur. **Saurabh** occupies the land without permission and earns money by selling crops. Later, the court decides that Laukendra is the rightful owner. The profits earned by Saurabh during the wrongful possession are called mesne profits, and he must pay them to Laukendra.

Another example: **Satyam** owns a shop in Varanasi. **Sachkeerat** occupies it illegally and earns rent from tenants. When the court restores the shop to Satyam, Sachkeerat must pay the profits he earned during the illegal occupation.

**Features of mesne profits:**

* They are compensation for wrongful possession.  
* They include actual income earned or which could reasonably have been earned.  
* They exclude improvements made by the wrongful possessor.  
* They are decided by the court based on evidence.

**Purpose:**  
 The purpose of mesne profits is to ensure fairness. The rightful owner should not suffer loss while someone else enjoys his property. It discourages wrongful possession and protects ownership rights.

**Conclusion:**  
 Mesne profits are a way to compensate the rightful owner for losses caused by wrongful possession. They ensure that no one benefits unfairly from property that does not belong to them. In simple words, mesne profits mean “paying back the earnings from property you held without right.”

## Q4. Answer the following:

1. Where will 'A' institute the suit for the pertition of immovable property? While his immovable properties are situated in Hardoi, Sitapur and Lucknow. 'A' resides in Varanasi.  
2. 'A' is personnel of a corporation makes an agreement with 'B' in Delhi 'A' fails to pay to 'B' accordance with agreement. 'B' is the resident of Lucknow and office of the corporation situated in Mumbai. Where will 'B' institute the suit?

---

### 4(i) Where will 'A' institute the suit for the partition of immovable property? While his immovable properties are situated in Hardoi, Sitapur and Lucknow. 'A' resides in Varanasi.

In civil procedure, the rule is that suits relating to immovable property must be filed in the court where the property is situated. This is explained in **Section 16 of the CPC**. The residence of the plaintiff does not matter in such cases. What matters is the location of the property.

So, if **A** owns properties in **Hardoi, Sitapur, and Lucknow**, and he wants to file a suit for partition, he must file the suit in a court that has jurisdiction over those properties. Since the properties are in different districts, the suit can be filed in any one of the courts where a part of the property is located, provided that court has jurisdiction over the whole matter.

For example, suppose **Prateek** owns land in Hardoi, Sitapur, and Lucknow. He lives in Varanasi. If he wants to partition the land among his brothers **Krishna** and **Kanishth**, he cannot file the suit in Varanasi just because he lives there. He must file it in Hardoi, Sitapur, or Lucknow court. If he files in Lucknow, the court can deal with the entire matter because part of the property is situated there.

**Conclusion:**  
 For partition of immovable property, the suit must be filed in the court where the property is located. Residence of the plaintiff is irrelevant. In this case, **A** can file the suit in Hardoi, Sitapur, or Lucknow, but not in Varanasi.

### 4(ii) 'A' is personnel of a corporation makes an agreement with 'B' in Delhi. 'A' fails to pay to 'B' accordance with agreement. 'B' is the resident of Lucknow and office of the corporation situated in Mumbai. Where will 'B' institute the suit?

In cases relating to contracts, the rule is that the suit can be filed in the court where the contract was made, where it was to be performed, or where the defendant resides or carries on business. This is explained in **Section 20 of the CPC**.

Here, the agreement between **A** and **B** was made in **Delhi**. The corporation’s office is in **Mumbai**. **B** lives in **Lucknow**. Since **A** failed to pay according to the agreement, **B** can file the suit either:

1. In Delhi, because the agreement was made there.  
2. In Mumbai, because the corporation has its office there and carries on business.

For example, suppose **Raghavendra** (corporation personnel) makes an agreement with **Laukendra** in Delhi. Later, Raghavendra fails to pay. Laukendra lives in Lucknow, but the corporation’s office is in Mumbai. Laukendra cannot file the suit in Lucknow just because he lives there. He must file it either in Delhi (place of agreement) or Mumbai (place of corporation’s office).

**Conclusion:**  
 In this case, **B** can institute the suit either in Delhi, where the agreement was made, or in Mumbai, where the corporation’s office is located. Lucknow is not a proper place for filing the suit.

## Q5. Comment on the following:

1. Institution of suit  
2. First hearing

---

### 5(a) Institution of suit

The institution of a suit means the formal beginning of a civil case in court. According to **Order IV Rule 1 of the CPC**, a suit is instituted by presenting a plaint to the court. A plaint is a written statement made by the plaintiff (the person filing the case) which contains the facts of the case, the relief sought, and other necessary details.

For example, suppose **Prateek** wants to recover money from **Krishna** in Lucknow. He prepares a plaint stating that Krishna borrowed ₹50,000 from him and has not repaid. He files this plaint in the Lucknow civil court. This act of filing the plaint is called institution of suit.

**Steps involved:**

1. **Presentation of plaint** – The plaintiff submits the plaint to the court.  
2. **Payment of court fees** – The plaintiff must pay the required court fees.  
3. **Registration of suit** – The court registers the suit after checking the plaint.  
4. **Issue of summons** – The court issues summons to the defendant to appear and answer the claim.

**Importance:**

* Institution of suit marks the start of legal proceedings.  
* It gives the court authority to hear the matter.  
* It informs the defendant about the claim.

**Conclusion:**  
 Institution of suit is the first step in civil litigation. It begins with filing a plaint, paying fees, and registering the case. Without proper institution, the court cannot proceed.

---

### 5(b) First hearing

The first hearing of a suit is the stage when the court examines the case after the defendant has appeared and filed his written statement. It is explained in **Order X CPC**. The purpose of the first hearing is to identify the issues in dispute and to decide how the case will proceed.

For example, suppose **Kanishth** sues **Raghavendra** in Allahabad court for possession of land. Raghavendra files his written statement denying the claim. On the first hearing, the court examines the plaint and written statement, listens to both parties, and frames the issues to be decided.

**Steps in first hearing:**

1. The court examines the pleadings of both parties.  
2. The court may ask parties to admit or deny documents.  
3. The court frames issues – the specific questions of fact or law to be decided.  
4. The court may fix dates for evidence and trial.

**Purpose:**

* To clarify the matters in dispute.  
* To avoid unnecessary evidence on admitted facts.  
* To prepare the case for trial.

**Example:** Suppose **Laukendra** sues **Saurabh** for recovery of rent in Sitapur. On the first hearing, the court frames issues like: (i) whether rent was due, (ii) whether Laukendra is entitled to recover it. This helps in focusing the trial.

**Conclusion:**  
 The first hearing is an important stage in civil procedure. It sets the direction of the case by framing issues and clarifying disputes. It ensures that the trial proceeds efficiently and only relevant matters are considered.

## Q6. Describe the provisions of arrest before judgement.

---

**6\. Describe the provisions of arrest before judgment**

Arrest before judgment is a special provision under the **Civil Procedure Code (CPC)** which allows the court to arrest a defendant even before the final judgment is delivered. This is provided in **Order XXXVIII Rules 1 to 4 CPC**. The purpose of this provision is to prevent the defendant from defeating the plaintiff’s claim by absconding or disposing of property before the case is decided. It is a precautionary measure to secure justice.

**Meaning:**  
 Arrest before judgment means that if the court believes the defendant may run away or hide to avoid paying the plaintiff if the case is decided against him, the court can order his arrest during the pendency of the suit. This ensures that the plaintiff’s rights are protected.

**Conditions for arrest before judgment:**  
 The court may order arrest before judgment if:

1. The defendant is about to leave the jurisdiction of the court to avoid the case.  
2. The defendant is about to dispose of his property to defeat the plaintiff’s claim.  
3. The court is satisfied that the defendant’s conduct shows he may obstruct justice.

**Procedure:**

* The plaintiff must apply to the court with an affidavit showing reasons why arrest is necessary.  
* The court may issue a warrant of arrest against the defendant.  
* The defendant may be released if he furnishes security to ensure he will appear and satisfy the decree if passed against him.  
* If the defendant fails to furnish security, he may be detained.

**Example for clarity:**  
 Suppose **Prateek** files a suit in Lucknow court against **Krishna** for recovery of ₹1,00,000. During the case, Prateek learns that Krishna is planning to leave India and settle abroad to avoid repayment. Prateek applies to the court for arrest before judgment. The court, after being satisfied, may order Krishna’s arrest to ensure he does not escape.

Another example: **Kanishth** sues **Raghavendra** in Allahabad for recovery of debt. Raghavendra starts selling his property secretly to avoid paying. The court may order his arrest before judgment to prevent injustice.

**Safeguards for defendant:**

* The court cannot order arrest before judgment casually; it must be satisfied with evidence.  
* The defendant can avoid arrest by furnishing security or surety.  
* The defendant’s rights are protected because arrest before judgment is not punishment but only a precaution.

**Limitations:**

* Arrest before judgment is not allowed in every case; it is used only in exceptional circumstances.  
* It cannot be used to harass the defendant.  
* The court must balance the rights of both parties.

**Importance:**  
 This provision is important because it prevents dishonest defendants from escaping liability. It ensures that the plaintiff’s claim is not defeated by fraud or evasion. It also strengthens the authority of the court by ensuring compliance with its orders.

**Conclusion:**  
 Arrest before judgment under Order XXXVIII CPC is a precautionary measure to secure justice. It allows the court to arrest a defendant if there is a risk that he may abscond or dispose of property to defeat the plaintiff’s claim. The defendant can avoid arrest by furnishing security. This provision balances fairness by protecting the plaintiff’s rights while safeguarding the defendant from misuse. In simple words, arrest before judgment means “catching the defendant before he runs away so that justice is not defeated.”

## Q7. In which cases temporary injunction may be granted? In which conditions the injunction to restrain to restrain repetition or continuance of breach?

**7\. In which cases temporary injunction may be granted? In which conditions the injunction to restrain repetition or continuance of breach?**

**Temporary Injunction – Meaning**  
 A temporary injunction is an order of the court which restrains a party from doing certain acts until the case is finally decided. It is provided under **Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC**. The purpose of a temporary injunction is to maintain the status quo and prevent injustice during the pendency of the suit.

For example, suppose **Prateek** files a suit in Lucknow court claiming ownership of agricultural land. He fears that **Krishna** may start cutting trees on the land before the case is decided. The court may grant a temporary injunction restraining Krishna from cutting trees until the case is resolved.

---

**Cases where temporary injunction may be granted (Order XXXIX Rule 1):**

1. **Property in danger of being wasted or damaged** – If the property in dispute is in danger of being wasted, damaged, or alienated by the defendant.

   * Example: **Kanishth** sues **Raghavendra** for ownership of a house in Allahabad. Raghavendra starts demolishing the house. The court may grant a temporary injunction to stop demolition.  
2. **Defendant threatens to dispose of property** – If the defendant threatens to dispose of or remove property to defeat the plaintiff’s claim.

   * Example: **Laukendra** sues **Saurabh** for recovery of debt. Saurabh starts selling his land in Sitapur to avoid payment. The court may grant injunction to stop sale.  
3. **Defendant threatens to dispossess plaintiff** – If the defendant threatens to dispossess the plaintiff or interfere with his possession.

   * Example: **Satyam** is in possession of a shop in Varanasi. **Sachkeerat** threatens to forcibly evict him. The court may grant injunction to protect Satyam’s possession.

---

**Conditions for injunction to restrain repetition or continuance of breach (Order XXXIX Rule 2):**  
 This provision applies when the defendant is committing a breach of contract or other injury and is likely to continue or repeat it. The court may grant injunction to restrain such repetition.

1. **Existence of a contract or legal right** – The plaintiff must show that he has a valid contract or legal right.

   * Example: **Prateek** has a contract with **Krishna** to supply goods. Krishna starts violating the contract by selling goods to others. The court may grant injunction to stop further breach.  
2. **Proof of breach or threat of breach** – The plaintiff must prove that the defendant has committed breach or is threatening to do so.

   * Example: **Kanishth** has exclusive rights to use a trademark in Allahabad. **Raghavendra** starts using the same trademark. The court may grant injunction to stop repetition.  
3. **Likelihood of repetition or continuance** – The court must be satisfied that the breach is likely to continue or be repeated.

   * Example: **Laukendra** owns a cinema hall in Sitapur. **Saurabh** repeatedly tries to block entry of customers. The court may grant injunction to restrain further interference.

---

**Principles guiding grant of temporary injunction:**

* **Prima facie case** – The plaintiff must show that he has a strong case.  
* **Balance of convenience** – The court must see which party will suffer more harm if injunction is granted or refused.  
* **Irreparable injury** – The plaintiff must show that he will suffer injury which cannot be compensated by money.

---

**Conclusion:**  
 Temporary injunction is a protective order to maintain fairness during litigation. It is granted when property is in danger, when defendant threatens disposal, or when plaintiff’s possession is threatened. Injunction to restrain repetition or continuance of breach is granted when there is proof of breach of contract or injury and likelihood of repetition. These provisions ensure that justice is not defeated by wrongful acts during the pendency of a case. In simple words, temporary injunction means “stop the defendant now so that the final judgment is not made useless later.”

## Q8. When security for costs may be required from plaintiff and what are the consequences of failure to furnish security ?

**8\. When security for costs may be required from plaintiff and what are the consequences of failure to furnish security?**

**Meaning of security for costs**  
 Security for costs means that the court may order the plaintiff (the person filing the case) to deposit money or provide security to cover the expenses of the defendant in case the suit fails. This provision is explained in **Order XXV of the CPC**. The purpose is to protect the defendant from unnecessary or frivolous litigation where the plaintiff may not be able to pay costs if he loses.

**When security for costs may be required:**  
 The court may order the plaintiff to furnish security in the following situations:

1. **Plaintiff resides outside India** – If the plaintiff lives outside India and it may be difficult to recover costs from him later.

   * Example: Suppose **Prateek**, who lives in London, files a suit against **Krishna** in Lucknow. The court may order Prateek to furnish security for costs because he resides outside India.  
2. **Plaintiff is insolvent or has insufficient means** – If the plaintiff has no sufficient property or income to pay costs if he loses.

   * Example: **Kanishth**, who has no property, files a suit against **Raghavendra** in Allahabad. The court may order him to furnish security for costs.  
3. **Frivolous or vexatious suits** – If the court feels the suit is filed only to harass the defendant and is unlikely to succeed.

   * Example: **Laukendra** files repeated suits against **Saurabh** in Sitapur without any strong claim. The court may order him to furnish security.  
4. **Company suits** – If a company files a suit and there is reason to believe it may not be able to pay costs.

   * Example: A small company represented by **Satyam** files a suit against **Sachkeerat** in Varanasi. The court may order the company to furnish security.

**Procedure:**

* The defendant must apply to the court requesting security for costs.  
* The court examines the circumstances and decides whether to order security.  
* The plaintiff is directed to deposit money or provide surety within a fixed time.

**Consequences of failure to furnish security:**  
 If the plaintiff fails to furnish security for costs within the time fixed by the court, the consequences are serious:

1. **Dismissal of suit** – The court may dismiss the suit.

   * Example: **Prateek** is ordered to furnish security in Lucknow court but fails to do so. His suit will be dismissed.  
2. **Protection of defendant** – The defendant is protected from unnecessary expenses and harassment.  
3. **Loss of opportunity for plaintiff** – The plaintiff loses the chance to pursue his claim unless he furnishes security.  
4. **Encouragement of genuine suits only** – This ensures that only serious plaintiffs with genuine claims file suits.

**Importance of security for costs:**

* It prevents misuse of the court system.  
* It protects defendants from frivolous litigation.  
* It ensures that plaintiffs think carefully before filing suits.  
* It balances fairness between both parties.

**Example for clarity:**  
 Suppose **Prateek**, living abroad, files a suit against **Krishna** in Lucknow. The court fears that if Prateek loses, Krishna will not be able to recover costs from him. The court orders Prateek to deposit ₹50,000 as security. If Prateek fails to deposit, the suit will be dismissed.

Another example: **Kanishth**, who has no property, files a weak suit against **Raghavendra**. The court orders him to furnish security. He fails to do so. The suit is dismissed, saving Raghavendra from harassment.

**Conclusion:**  
 Security for costs under Order XXV CPC is a safeguard against frivolous and dishonest litigation. It is ordered when the plaintiff resides outside India, is insolvent, or files vexatious suits. If the plaintiff fails to furnish security, the suit may be dismissed. This provision ensures fairness, protects defendants, and encourages only genuine claims to be brought before the court. In simple words, security for costs means “deposit money first if your case looks doubtful, or else your suit may be dismissed.”

## Q9. Explain the following phrases:

(a) Attendance and examination of witness before commissioner  
(b) Cases in which High Court may issue commission to examine witness  
---

### 9(a) Attendance and examination of witness before commissioner

Sometimes courts appoint a commissioner to record evidence instead of doing it directly in court. This is provided under **Order XVIII Rule 4 and Order XXVI CPC**. The commissioner is usually a lawyer or officer appointed by the court. The purpose is to save time and to make the process more convenient.

**Attendance of witness:**  
 When a commissioner is appointed, the parties must produce their witnesses before him. The commissioner issues notice to the witnesses to attend. The witnesses then appear before the commissioner at the place and time fixed.

**Examination of witness:**  
 The commissioner records the evidence of the witnesses. He asks them questions, notes their answers, and prepares a report. The examination is done in the same way as in court – first examination‑in‑chief, then cross‑examination, and re‑examination.

**Example:** Suppose **Prateek** files a suit against **Krishna** in Lucknow. The court appoints a commissioner to record evidence because the case is lengthy. **Kanishth** and **Raghavendra** are witnesses. They attend before the commissioner, who records their statements. Later, the commissioner submits the report to the court.

**Conclusion:**  
 Attendance and examination of witnesses before commissioner is a method to speed up trials. It reduces burden on the court and ensures evidence is properly recorded.

---

### 9(b) Cases in which High Court may issue commission to examine witness

Under **Order XXVI CPC**, the High Court has power to issue a commission to examine witnesses in certain cases. This is done when it is difficult or inconvenient for the witness to attend court.

**Cases include:**

1. **Witness residing far away** – If the witness lives outside the jurisdiction of the court.

   * Example: **Laukendra** files a case in Allahabad, but his witness **Saurabh** lives in Chennai. The High Court may issue commission to record his evidence there.  
2. **Witness unable to attend due to illness or old age** – If the witness is sick or too old to travel.

   * Example: **Satyam** is a 90‑year‑old witness in Varanasi. The High Court may issue commission to record his evidence at home.  
3. **Witness is a government officer** – If the witness is a high‑ranking officer whose presence in court may disturb public service.

   * Example: **Sachkeerat** is a senior officer in Delhi. The High Court may issue commission to record his evidence in his office.

**Conclusion:**  
 The High Court issues commission to examine witnesses when personal attendance is difficult or impractical. This ensures justice is not delayed and witnesses can still give evidence without hardship.

## Q10. Answer the following: 

1. What is Interpleader Suit? Refer the provisions of section and order.  
2. 'A' deposits a box of jewels with 'B' as his agent. He then writes to 'C' for the purpose of making the jewels a security for a debt due from himself to 'C'. 'A' afterward alleges that C's debt is satisfied and 'C' alleges the contrary. Who may institute the suit?

---

### 10(i) What is an Interpleader Suit? Refer to the provisions of section and order.

An interpleader suit is a special type of suit under **Section 88 and Order XXXV of the CPC**. It is filed when a person is holding property or money but two or more other persons claim ownership of it. The holder himself does not claim any right over the property; he only wants the court to decide who the real owner is. The purpose is to protect the holder from multiple claims and disputes.

**Meaning:**  
 Suppose **Prateek** is holding ₹1,00,000 which both **Krishna** and **Kanishth** claim as theirs. Prateek himself does not claim the money. He can file an interpleader suit in court asking the judge to decide whether Krishna or Kanishth is the rightful owner.

**Conditions for interpleader suit:**

1. The plaintiff (holder) must not claim any interest in the property except charges or costs.  
2. There must be rival claims by two or more defendants.  
3. The plaintiff must be willing to hand over the property to the rightful claimant.

**Procedure:**

* The plaintiff files the suit under Order XXXV CPC.  
* The court issues notice to the defendants.  
* The defendants contest their claims.  
* The court decides who is entitled to the property.

**Conclusion:**  
 An interpleader suit is a protective remedy for a person caught between rival claimants. It ensures fairness and prevents harassment of the holder.

---

### 10(ii) 'A' deposits a box of jewels with 'B' as his agent. He then writes to 'C' for the purpose of making the jewels a security for a debt due from himself to 'C'. 'A' afterward alleges that C's debt is satisfied and 'C' alleges the contrary. Who may institute the suit?

In this case, **B** is the agent holding the jewels. Both **A** and **C** are making rival claims over the jewels. **A** says the debt is already satisfied, while **C** says it is not. **B** himself has no personal claim over the jewels; he is only holding them.

According to the principle of interpleader suit under **Section 88 and Order XXXV CPC**, the person who is holding the property but faces rival claims can institute the suit. Here, **B** is the one holding the jewels and facing claims from both **A** and **C**. Therefore, **B** may institute the suit.

**Example for clarity:**  
 Suppose **Laukendra** deposits jewels with **Saurabh** as his agent. Later, he writes to **Satyam** making the jewels security for a debt. Laukendra then says the debt is cleared, but Satyam denies it. Here, Saurabh is holding the jewels and is caught between Laukendra and Satyam. Saurabh can file an interpleader suit asking the court to decide whether Laukendra or Satyam is entitled to the jewels.

**Conclusion:**  
 In this situation, **B**, the agent holding the jewels, may institute the suit. He is the neutral party caught between rival claims and can seek the court’s help to decide the rightful claimant.

## Q1. Define Decree and Order. Write down any six major differences between decree and order.

---

**Define Decree and Order. Write down any six major differences between decree and order.**

**Decree**  
 A decree is the formal expression of an adjudication by a civil court which conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit. It is defined under Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). For example, if Prateek sues Krishna for possession of a house in Lucknow and the court finally decides that the house belongs to Prateek, that decision expressed formally is a decree.

**Order**  
 An order is the formal expression of any decision of a civil court which is not a decree. It is defined under Section 2(14) of CPC. For example, if in the same case the court directs Krishna to produce certain documents before the next hearing, that direction is an order.

**Six Major Differences between Decree and Order**

1. **Definition**

   * Decree: Formal adjudication conclusively determining rights of parties in a suit.  
   * Order: Formal expression of any decision of a civil court which is not a decree.  
2. **Scope**

   * Decree arises only in a suit instituted by presentation of a plaint.  
   * Order may arise in a suit or in other proceedings (like applications).  
3. **Conclusive Nature**

   * Decree conclusively determines rights of parties.  
   * Order may or may not finally determine rights; often procedural.  
4. **Appealability**

   * Every decree is appealable unless expressly barred.  
   * Only certain orders are appealable under Section 104 and Order 43 CPC.  
5. **Number**

   * In one suit, there can be only one decree (though it may be preliminary or final).  
   * In one suit, there can be multiple orders at different stages.  
6. **Examples**

   * Decree: Court declares that Raghavendra is the rightful owner of land in Kanpur.  
   * Order: Court directs Laukendra to pay interim costs or produce evidence.

**Illustrative Example**  
 Suppose Saurabh files a suit against Satyam for recovery of ₹1,00,000. The court finally decides that Saurabh is entitled to ₹80,000. That final decision is a decree. During the proceedings, the court may pass orders like directing Sachkeerat to appear as a witness or granting adjournment. These are orders.

**Conclusion**  
 Thus, a decree is the final determination of rights in a suit, while an order is any other decision of the court. Both are important, but decrees have greater legal weight as they settle disputes conclusively, whereas orders mainly regulate procedure. Understanding the distinction helps in knowing remedies available to parties, especially regarding appeals.

## Q2. Discuss, against whom the mesne profit can be claimed? How is it assessed?

---

**Against whom the mesne profit can be claimed? How is it assessed?**

**Meaning of Mesne Profits**  
 The term *mesne profits* is defined under Section 2(12) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). It refers to the profits which a person in wrongful possession of property actually received or might with ordinary diligence have received, together with interest. In simple words, mesne profits are compensation payable by a person who has unlawfully occupied another’s property and enjoyed its benefits.

For example, if Krishna wrongfully occupies Prateek’s farmland in Lucknow and earns ₹50,000 per year by selling crops, Prateek can claim mesne profits for the period of wrongful possession.

---

**Against Whom Mesne Profits Can Be Claimed**

Mesne profits can be claimed against:

* **Wrongful Possessor**: The person who has unlawfully occupied the property. Example: Raghavendra occupies Laukendra’s house in Kanpur without legal right. Laukendra can claim mesne profits against Raghavendra.  
* **Trespasser**: Any person who enters and enjoys property without lawful authority. Example: Saurabh trespasses into Satyam’s shop in Faizabad and earns rent from subletting. Satyam can claim mesne profits.  
* **Tenant Holding Over**: A tenant who continues to occupy property after expiry of lease without landlord’s consent. Example: Sachkeerat’s lease of Krishna’s house ends, but he continues to live there and earns rent by subletting rooms. Krishna can claim mesne profits.  
* **Person in Possession after Decree**: If a decree is passed in favor of one party but the other continues to hold possession, mesne profits can be claimed for the period after decree until delivery of possession.

Thus, mesne profits are always claimed against the person who has enjoyed unlawful possession and derived benefit from property.

---

**Assessment of Mesne Profits**

The court assesses mesne profits based on certain principles:

1. **Actual Income Derived**

   * The wrongful possessor’s actual income from the property is considered.  
   * Example: If Kanishth occupies Prateek’s agricultural land and earns ₹1,00,000 annually from crops, mesne profits equal that amount.  
2. **Potential Income with Ordinary Diligence**

   * Even if the wrongful possessor did not earn, the court considers what he could have earned with reasonable care.  
   * Example: Raghavendra occupies Laukendra’s orchard but leaves it unused. The court may calculate profits based on average fruit yield.  
3. **Exclusion of Improvements**

   * Profits due to improvements made by wrongful possessor are not included.  
   * Example: If Saurabh builds a factory on Satyam’s land and earns huge profits, only the natural income of land is considered, not profits due to factory.  
4. **Deduction of Expenses**

   * Necessary expenses incurred for earning income are deducted.  
   * Example: If Sachkeerat spends ₹20,000 on irrigation for crops, that amount is deducted from mesne profits.  
5. **Interest**

   * Courts generally allow interest on mesne profits from the date of possession till payment.  
6. **Period of Claim**

   * Mesne profits are assessed for the period of wrongful possession only.

---

**Illustrative Example**  
 Suppose Krishna wrongfully occupies Prateek’s house in Lucknow from 2019 to 2021 and earns ₹10,000 per month by renting it to tenants. Prateek files a suit in 2022\. The court may order Krishna to pay mesne profits of ₹10,000 × 24 months \= ₹2,40,000 plus interest.

---

**Conclusion**  
 Mesne profits are a form of compensation ensuring that the rightful owner is not deprived of the benefits of his property. They can be claimed against any person in wrongful possession—whether trespasser, tenant holding over, or decree‑holder refusing to vacate. Courts assess mesne profits by considering actual or potential income, deducting expenses, and adding interest. The principle is simple: no one should unjustly enrich himself at the cost of another’s property rights.

## Q3. "For the application of the doctrine of Res-judicata, the matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must have been heard and decided by the court in the former suit." Analyse the above statement with the help of any three decided leading cases.

**Direct Answer:**  
 The doctrine of *Res Judicata* under Section 11 CPC means that once a matter has been directly and substantially decided by a competent court, the same issue cannot be re‑litigated between the same parties. Leading cases like **Sheoparsan Singh v. Ramnandan Prasad (1916)**, **Satyadhyan Ghosal v. Deorajin Debi (1960)**, and **Daryao v. State of U.P. (1961)** illustrate how courts applied this principle to ensure finality of litigation.

---

**Explanation of the Statement**

The statement emphasizes that for *Res Judicata* to apply:

* The matter must be **directly and substantially in issue** in both suits.  
* It must have been **heard and finally decided** by a competent court.  
* The parties in both suits must be the same or claiming under the same title.

This prevents repetitive litigation and protects judicial time.

---

**Case 1: Sheoparsan Singh v. Ramnandan Prasad (1916) [Casemine](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/in/56b49613607dba348f01676e)**

* **Facts**: Dispute over property rights was decided earlier by a competent court. Later, one party tried to reopen the same issue in another suit.  
* **Principle**: The Privy Council held that once a matter has been adjudicated, it cannot be re‑agitated.  
* **Example**: Suppose Prateek sues Krishna for ownership of farmland in Lucknow. If the court decides in favor of Prateek, Krishna cannot file another suit on the same ownership issue.

---

**Case 2: Satyadhyan Ghosal v. Deorajin Debi (1960) [Indian Kanoon](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/655045/)**

* **Facts**: Landlords obtained a decree of eviction. Tenants tried to reopen the matter through successive applications.  
* **Principle**: The Supreme Court held that *Res Judicata* applies not only to final decisions but also to interlocutory orders if they have been finally decided.  
* **Example**: If Raghavendra is evicted from Laukendra’s house in Kanpur by decree, he cannot file repeated applications challenging the same eviction order.

**Case 3: Daryao v. State of U.P. (1961) [Indian Kanoon](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/414792/)**

* **Facts**: Petitioners filed writ petitions in High Court which were dismissed. They then approached the Supreme Court under Article 32 raising the same issues.  
* **Principle**: The Supreme Court held that *Res Judicata* applies even to writ petitions. Once a High Court decides a matter, the same issue cannot be re‑litigated in Supreme Court.  
* **Example**: If Saurabh files a writ in Allahabad High Court against government acquisition of his land and loses, he cannot file another writ in Supreme Court on the same grounds.

---

**Conclusion**

The doctrine of *Res Judicata* ensures **finality of litigation** and prevents harassment through repeated suits. The three leading cases show that once a matter is directly and substantially decided, it cannot be reopened—whether in civil suits, interlocutory proceedings, or writ petitions. This principle protects judicial efficiency and upholds justice by avoiding duplication of disputes.

## Q4. Discuss the remedies against Ex-parte Decree.

**Remedies against Ex‑parte Decree (Part i: Meaning and Remedies under CPC)**

**Meaning of Ex‑parte Decree**  
 An *ex‑parte decree* is a decree passed by the court when the defendant does not appear despite being duly served with summons. For example, if Prateek files a suit against Krishna in Lucknow court and Krishna fails to appear, the court may proceed ex‑parte and decide in favor of Prateek.

**Remedies under CPC**

1. **Application to Set Aside Ex‑parte Decree (Order IX Rule 13 CPC)**

   * The defendant can apply to set aside the decree by showing sufficient cause for non‑appearance.  
   * Example: If Raghavendra missed hearing because he was hospitalized in Kanpur, he can apply to set aside the decree.  
2. **Appeal (Section 96(2) CPC)**

   * The defendant can file a regular appeal against the ex‑parte decree.  
   * Example: Laukendra may appeal to the High Court if he believes the trial court wrongly passed decree against him.  
3. **Review (Order XLVII CPC)**

   * The defendant may seek review if there is an error apparent on the face of record.  
   * Example: Saurabh can apply for review if the decree wrongly calculated damages.  
4. **Suit for Setting Aside Decree on Grounds of Fraud**

   * If decree was obtained by fraud, a separate suit can be filed.  
   * Example: Satyam proves that Sachkeerat misled the court with forged documents.

**Conclusion**  
 Thus, remedies include application under Order IX Rule 13, appeal, review, or separate suit for fraud. The law balances fairness by giving defendants a chance to contest while ensuring decrees are not lightly disturbed.

---

**Remedies against Ex‑parte Decree (Part ii: Practical Application and Examples)**

**Practical Grounds for Setting Aside**

* **Improper Service of Summons**: If summons was not duly served, decree can be set aside. Example: Krishna never received summons because it was wrongly delivered to another house in Lucknow.  
* **Sufficient Cause for Absence**: Illness, accident, or unavoidable circumstances. Example: Kanishth missed hearing due to train accident while traveling from Faizabad.  
* **Fraud or Misrepresentation**: If plaintiff misled court. Example: Raghavendra produced false rent receipts against Laukendra.

**Procedure**

* Defendant files application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC.  
* Court examines evidence of absence or fraud.  
* If satisfied, court sets aside decree and restores suit for hearing.

**Limitations**

* Application must be filed within 30 days of knowledge of decree.  
* Defendant must show genuine cause; negligence is not excused.  
* Example: If Saurabh simply ignored summons, he cannot later claim remedy.

**Illustrative Example**  
 Suppose Sachkeerat sues Satyam for recovery of ₹50,000 in Lucknow. Satyam fails to appear because summons was wrongly served at another address. Court passes ex‑parte decree. Later, Satyam applies under Order IX Rule 13 showing proof of wrong service. Court sets aside decree and reopens case.

**Conclusion**  
 Remedies against ex‑parte decree ensure justice by protecting absent defendants from unfair decrees, while discouraging negligence. Courts carefully balance rights of both parties, allowing genuine cases to be reopened but preventing misuse of delay tactics.

---

## Q5. What do you mean by the Jurisdiction of a Civil court? Discuss the basis on which it is decided.

**Jurisdiction of a Civil Court**

**Meaning of Jurisdiction**  
 Jurisdiction means the legal authority of a court to hear and decide a case. If a court does not have jurisdiction, its decision is void. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) provides that civil courts have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature unless barred.

👍 Example, if Prateek files a suit against Krishna for ownership of land in Lucknow, only the court having jurisdiction over Lucknow property can decide. If he files in Kanpur court, that court has no jurisdiction.

---

**Basis on Which Jurisdiction is Decided**

1. **Subject‑Matter Jurisdiction**

   * Refers to the type of case a court can hear.  
   * Example: A family court can hear divorce cases but not property disputes. If Raghavendra files a divorce case in a civil court at Kanpur, it will be transferred to family court.  
2. **Territorial Jurisdiction**

   * Based on geographical limits of court’s authority.  
   * Example: If Laukendra’s house is in Lucknow, only Lucknow court has jurisdiction over disputes relating to that house. Kanpur court cannot decide.  
3. **Pecuniary Jurisdiction**

   * Based on monetary value of the claim.  
   * Example: If Saurabh sues Satyam for ₹50,000, the suit may lie in a lower civil court. But if claim is ₹10 lakh, it may lie in District Court.  
4. **Jurisdiction by Bar of Law**

   * Certain matters are barred from civil courts by statutes.  
   * Example: Income tax disputes are decided by tax tribunals, not civil courts. If Sachkeerat files suit in civil court against tax demand, it will be dismissed.  
5. **Jurisdiction by Consent**

   * Parties cannot confer jurisdiction by agreement if law does not allow.  
   * Example: Krishna and Prateek cannot agree to file property dispute in Faizabad court if property is in Lucknow.  
6. **Jurisdiction by Cause of Action**

   * Place where cause of action arises gives jurisdiction.  
   * Example: If defamatory article is published in Lucknow against Kanishth, Lucknow court has jurisdiction.

---

**Illustrative Example**  
 Suppose Prateek, resident of Lucknow, sues Krishna, resident of Kanpur, for recovery of ₹2 lakh borrowed in Faizabad.

* Territorial jurisdiction: Suit can be filed in Lucknow (where plaintiff resides), Kanpur (where defendant resides), or Faizabad (where cause of action arose).  
* Pecuniary jurisdiction: If claim is ₹2 lakh, it must be filed in court competent to try suits of that value.  
* Subject‑matter jurisdiction: Since it is a money recovery suit, civil court has jurisdiction.

---

**Importance of Jurisdiction**

* Ensures cases are heard by proper court.  
* Prevents conflicting decisions.  
* Protects parties from harassment.  
* Provides certainty in law.

---

**Conclusion**  
 Jurisdiction of a civil court is decided on the basis of subject matter, territory, pecuniary value, statutory bar, and cause of action. A decree passed without jurisdiction is null and void. Thus, jurisdiction is the foundation of judicial authority, ensuring that disputes are resolved by the right court in the right place and manner.

## Q6. Explain Joinder, Mis-joinder and Non-joinder of parties with the help of factual examples. Discuss its effects.

**Joinder, Mis‑joinder and Non‑joinder of Parties**

**Joinder of Parties**  

Joinder means including proper parties in a suit so that the court can effectively and completely decide the matter. It is governed by **Order I CPC**.

* **Joinder of Plaintiffs**: Two or more persons may join as plaintiffs if they have the same interest in the suit.  
* **Joinder of Defendants**: Two or more persons may be joined as defendants if relief is claimed against them jointly.

**Example**: Prateek and Krishna jointly own a house in Lucknow. Raghavendra trespasses into the house. Both Prateek and Krishna can join as plaintiffs against Raghavendra. Similarly, if Laukendra and Saurabh together occupy the house unlawfully, both can be joined as defendants.

**Mis‑joinder of Parties**  

Mis‑joinder occurs when parties who should not be joined are included in the suit. It may be of two types:

* **Mis‑joinder of Plaintiffs**: Plaintiffs without common interest are joined.  
* **Mis‑joinder of Defendants**: Defendants against whom no common relief is claimed are joined.

**Example**: Kanishth sues both Satyam and Sachkeerat in one suit—Satyam for recovery of loan and Sachkeerat for trespass on land. Since the causes of action are different, this is mis‑joinder.

**Non‑joinder of Parties**  

Non‑joinder occurs when a necessary party is not included in the suit. A necessary party is one without whom the court cannot pass an effective decree.

* **Example**: Prateek sues Krishna for partition of ancestral property in Kanpur but does not include Raghavendra, another co‑sharer. This is non‑joinder because without Raghavendra, the court cannot effectively decide partition.

**Effects of Joinder, Mis‑joinder and Non‑joinder**

1. **Joinder**  
   * Ensures complete and effective adjudication.  
   * Prevents multiplicity of suits.  
   * Example: If Prateek and Krishna sue together, one decree settles dispute for both.  
2. **Mis‑joinder**  
   * Suit is not dismissed merely for mis‑joinder (Order I Rule 9 CPC).  
   * Court may strike out unnecessary parties.  
   * Example: If Kanishth wrongly joins Satyam and Sachkeerat, court may remove one party and continue suit against the other.  
3. **Non‑joinder**  
   * If a necessary party is not joined, suit may fail.  
   * Example: Partition suit without Raghavendra cannot be decided.  
   * But if only a proper party is missing (not necessary), suit may continue.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Laukendra and Saurabh jointly occupy Prateek’s shop in Lucknow. Prateek sues only Laukendra. This is **non‑joinder** of Saurabh, a necessary party. The court may dismiss suit because decree against Laukendra alone cannot restore full possession.

If Prateek sues both Krishna (for loan recovery) and Raghavendra (for trespass) in one suit, this is **mis‑joinder** because causes of action differ. Court may separate suits.

If Prateek and Krishna jointly sue Raghavendra for trespass, this is proper **joinder** ensuring complete relief.

**Conclusion**  

Joinder, mis‑joinder and non‑joinder are procedural rules ensuring proper parties are before the court. Joinder promotes efficiency, mis‑joinder can be corrected without dismissal, but non‑joinder of necessary parties may defeat the suit. The principle is simple: all persons whose presence is essential for effective adjudication must be included, while unnecessary parties should be excluded.

## Q7. Discuss the Triple Test principles for granting the injunction order under the code of civil procedure.

**Triple Test Principles for Granting Injunction Order under CPC**

**Meaning of Injunction**  

An injunction is a judicial order restraining a party from doing certain acts or directing them to perform certain acts. Under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), temporary injunctions are governed by **Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2**. Courts grant injunctions to preserve rights and prevent irreparable harm until the final decision.

For example, if Prateek files a suit against Krishna to stop construction on disputed land in Lucknow, he may seek a temporary injunction to restrain Krishna until the case is decided.

**Triple Test Principles**  

Courts follow three essential tests before granting injunctions. These are known as the **Triple Test Principles**:

1. **Prima Facie Case**  
   * The applicant must show a genuine case with legal merit.  
   * It does not mean proving the case finally, but showing that there is a serious question to be tried.  
   * Example: Raghavendra claims ownership of land in Kanpur and produces sale deed. Court sees that there is a valid dispute. This establishes prima facie case.  
2. **Balance of Convenience**  
   * Court considers which party will suffer greater hardship if injunction is granted or refused.  
   * Example: Laukendra seeks injunction against Saurabh to stop demolition of his shop. If injunction is refused, Laukendra loses shop permanently. If granted, Saurabh only faces delay. Balance of convenience favors Laukendra.  
3. **Irreparable Injury**  
   * Applicant must show that refusal of injunction would cause harm which cannot be compensated by money.  
   * Example: Satyam seeks injunction against Sachkeerat to stop cutting of ancestral trees in Faizabad. If trees are cut, they cannot be restored. This is irreparable injury.

**Application of Triple Test**  

Courts apply all three tests together. If any one test fails, injunction may not be granted.

* Example: Kanishth seeks injunction against Prateek to stop publication of article. Court finds no prima facie case because article is not defamatory. Injunction is refused.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna claiming ownership of farmland in Lucknow. Krishna starts construction of a factory.

* Prima facie case: Prateek shows sale deed proving ownership.  
* Balance of convenience: If injunction is refused, factory will be built and land altered permanently. If granted, Krishna only faces delay.

Irreparable injury: Once factory is built, farmland cannot be restored.

* Court grants injunction restraining Krishna from construction until case is decided.

**Judicial Approach**  

Courts emphasize that injunction is an equitable remedy, not a matter of right. It is granted only when all three tests are satisfied. The principle ensures fairness and prevents misuse of injunctions to harass opponents.

**Conclusion**  

The Triple Test—prima facie case, balance of convenience, and irreparable injury—is the guiding principle for granting injunctions under CPC. It ensures that injunctions are granted only in genuine cases where refusal would cause serious harm. This protects rights of parties while preventing abuse of process.

## Q8. Describe the law related to filing any civil suit by or against Government or public officers.

**Civil Suits by or against Government or Public Officer**

**Relevant Provisions**

The law relating to suits by or against the Government or public officers is contained in **Sections 79 to 82 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**. These provisions ensure that when the Government or its officers are involved in litigation, special safeguards and procedures are followed to protect public interest while also giving citizens a fair chance to sue.

**Suits by Government**

* When the Government itself is the plaintiff, the suit is filed in the name of the Union of India or the State concerned.  
* Example: If Krishna illegally occupies railway land in Lucknow, the suit will be filed as “Union of India v. Krishna.”

**Suits against Government**

* When the Government is the defendant, the suit must be filed against the Union of India or the State concerned, not against individual departments.  
* Example: If Prateek sues the State of Uttar Pradesh for wrongful acquisition of his land in Kanpur, the defendant will be “State of Uttar Pradesh,” not the Revenue Department.

**Suits against Public Officers**

* If a public officer is sued for acts done in official capacity, the suit must state that the act was done in such capacity.  
* Example: If Raghavendra, a police officer in Faizabad, wrongfully seizes Laukendra’s property while acting officially, Laukendra must sue Raghavendra in his official capacity.

**Notice under Section 80 CPC**

* Before filing a suit against Government or public officer, a **two‑month prior notice** is mandatory.  
* The notice must state cause of action, relief claimed, and details of plaintiff.  
* Purpose: To give Government time to examine claim and possibly settle without litigation.  
* Example: Saurabh wants to sue State of U.P. for damages caused by wrongful demolition of his shop in Lucknow. He must first serve notice under Section 80 CPC and wait two months before filing suit.

**Exceptions to Notice Requirement**

* In urgent cases where immediate relief is needed, suit may be filed without notice, but court must grant leave.  
* Example: Satyam seeks urgent injunction against Sachkeerat, a government officer, to stop demolition of his house. Court may allow suit without notice.

**Procedure and Representation**

* Government is represented by authorized officers or pleaders.  
* Decrees against Government are executed like ordinary decrees but with safeguards to protect public funds.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek’s farmland in Lucknow is wrongly acquired by the State without compensation.

* He serves notice under Section 80 CPC to the State of U.P. stating cause of action and relief.  
* After two months, he files suit against “State of Uttar Pradesh.”  
* If Raghavendra, a revenue officer, acted wrongfully in official capacity, Prateek may also sue him in his official capacity.  
* Court hears matter and passes decree for compensation.

**Importance of Provisions**

* Protects Government from frivolous suits.  
* Gives opportunity to settle disputes without litigation.  
* Ensures accountability of public officers.  
* Balances citizen’s right to sue with Government’s need for orderly administration.

**Conclusion**  

The CPC provides a structured framework for suits involving Government or public officers. Notice under Section 80 is the cornerstone, ensuring fairness and preventing surprise litigation. While Government enjoys certain safeguards, citizens retain the right to seek justice. The law thus balances public interest with individual rights.

## Q9. Explain the various purposes of Commission under the Code of Civil Procedure.

**Commission under the Code of Civil Procedure**

**Meaning of Commission**  

A *commission* is an order issued by the court under **Sections 75–78 and Order XXVI CPC** authorizing a person (called commissioner) to perform certain acts like examining witnesses, inspecting property, or conducting inquiries. The purpose is to assist the court in effective adjudication when direct performance by the court is difficult or inconvenient.

For example, if Prateek files a suit against Krishna in Lucknow and a key witness lives in Kanpur and cannot travel, the court may issue a commission to record his evidence at Kanpur.

**Purposes of Commission**

1. **Examination of Witnesses**  
   * When witnesses cannot attend court due to distance, illness, or other valid reasons, commission is issued to record their evidence.  
   * Example: Raghavendra, a witness in a property dispute at Lucknow, lives in Faizabad and is bedridden. Court appoints commissioner to record his statement at Faizabad.  
2. **Local Investigation**  
   * Commission may be issued to inspect property or conduct local inquiry.  
   * Example: Laukendra sues Saurabh for encroachment on land in Kanpur. Court appoints commissioner to measure land and report encroachment.  
3. **Examination of Accounts**  
   * In suits involving complicated accounts, commissioner may be appointed to examine and prepare report.  
   * Example: Satyam and Sachkeerat are partners in a business at Lucknow. Dispute arises over profit sharing. Court appoints commissioner to check accounts.  
4. **Partition of Property**  
   * In partition suits, commissioner may be appointed to divide property and suggest allotments.  
   * Example: Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth seek partition of ancestral house in Faizabad. Court appoints commissioner to divide property fairly.  
5. **Conducting Sale of Property**  
   * Commissioner may be appointed to sell property and distribute proceeds.  
   * Example: Raghavendra’s mortgaged property in Kanpur is ordered to be sold. Court appoints commissioner to conduct sale.  
6. **Examination of Documents**  
   * Commissioner may be directed to examine documents and submit report.  
   * Example: Laukendra produces old rent receipts in dispute with Saurabh. Court appoints commissioner to verify authenticity.  
7. **Scientific or Expert Investigation**  
   * In technical matters, commissioner may be appointed to conduct expert inquiry.  
   * Example: Satyam claims damage to machinery in Lucknow factory. Court appoints engineer as commissioner to inspect machinery.

**Advantages of Commission**

* Saves time and expense of court.  
* Provides accurate local or technical information.  
* Ensures justice when witnesses or evidence are inaccessible.  
* Helps court in complex matters like accounts or partition.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna for boundary dispute in Lucknow. Witnesses live in Kanpur and cannot travel. Court appoints commissioner to record their evidence at Kanpur. Commissioner also inspects disputed boundary and submits report. Based on this, court decides case effectively.

**Conclusion**  

Commission under CPC is a vital tool enabling courts to gather evidence, conduct inquiries, and resolve disputes efficiently. It ensures justice by overcoming practical difficulties like distance, illness, or technical complexity. Thus, commissions serve the purpose of assisting courts in delivering fair and complete adjudication.

## Q10. What is the objective of Summary Procedure ? Explain the differences between Summary Procedure and Trial of Ordinary Civil Suit.

**Objective of Summary Procedure**

**Meaning**  

Summary procedure is a special fast‑track procedure provided under **Order XXXVII CPC**. It applies mainly to suits based on negotiable instruments (like promissory notes, bills of exchange, cheques) and suits for recovery of debt or liquidated demand.

**Objective**  

The main objective is to prevent unnecessary delay in cases where the defendant has no real defense. It ensures speedy justice in commercial matters.

* Example: If Prateek lends ₹1,00,000 to Krishna in Lucknow and Krishna issues a promissory note but fails to pay, Prateek can file a summary suit. Krishna cannot delay proceedings by raising false defenses.

**Key Features**

* Defendant cannot defend suit unless he obtains leave of court.  
* Court grants leave only if defendant shows a substantial defense.  
* If leave is refused, decree is passed immediately.  
* This saves time and prevents misuse of procedure.

**Differences between Summary Procedure and Ordinary Civil Trial**

1. **Scope**  
   * Summary Procedure: Limited to suits on negotiable instruments and recovery of debt/liquidated demand.  
   * Ordinary Trial: Applies to all civil suits of a civil nature.  
2. **Right to Defend**  
   * Summary Procedure: Defendant must seek leave to defend by showing substantial defense.  
   * Ordinary Trial: Defendant has automatic right to file written statement and contest.  
3. **Speed of Disposal**  
   * Summary Procedure: Designed for quick disposal; decree may be passed if defense is weak.  
   * Ordinary Trial: Follows full procedure—pleadings, framing of issues, evidence, arguments, judgment.  
4. **Stages of Trial**  
   * Summary Procedure: Limited stages; if leave refused, decree passed without trial.  
   * Ordinary Trial: Multiple stages including examination of witnesses, cross‑examination, etc.  
5. **Examples**  
   * Summary Procedure: Saurabh sues Satyam on dishonored cheque of ₹50,000. Court asks Satyam to show defense. If he fails, decree is passed quickly.  
   * Ordinary Trial: Laukendra sues Raghavendra for partition of ancestral property in Kanpur. Full trial with evidence and witnesses is required.  
6. **Objective**  
   * Summary Procedure: To prevent frivolous defenses and ensure speedy justice in commercial matters.  
   * Ordinary Trial: To ensure complete adjudication of disputes, even if complex.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow for recovery of ₹2 lakh based on a promissory note.

* In **summary procedure**, Krishna must apply for leave to defend. If he shows no valid defense, decree is passed immediately.  
* In **ordinary trial**, Krishna can file written statement, raise multiple defenses, and case proceeds through evidence and arguments, taking longer time.

**Conclusion**  

The objective of summary procedure is to provide speedy justice in cases where liability is clear and defenses are frivolous. It differs from ordinary civil trial by restricting defendant’s right to defend and shortening stages of trial. While ordinary suits ensure full adjudication of complex disputes, summary suits focus on efficiency and quick relief in commercial matters.

## Q1. Define Decree. What are its essentials? Explain the difference between preliminary and final decree.

**Decree: Definition**  

A *decree* is defined under **Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**. It is the formal expression of an adjudication by a civil court which conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit.

For example, if Prateek sues Krishna for ownership of a house in Lucknow and the court finally decides that the house belongs to Prateek, the formal decision expressed by the court is a decree.

**Essentials of a Decree**  

For an adjudication to be a decree, the following essentials must be satisfied:

1. **Adjudication by Court**  
   * There must be a judicial decision by a civil court.  
   * Example: If Raghavendra and Laukendra dispute ownership of land in Kanpur, the court’s decision is adjudication.  
2. **Suit Instituted**  
   * Decree arises only in a suit instituted by presentation of a plaint.  
   * Example: If Saurabh files a plaint against Satyam for recovery of loan, the court’s final decision is a decree.  
3. **Determination of Rights**  
   * The decree must conclusively determine rights of parties.  
   * Example: If Sachkeerat claims tenancy rights and court declares him tenant, that is determination of rights.  
4. **Conclusive Decision**  
   * The decision must be final regarding the matter in controversy.  
   * Example: If Krishna is declared owner of farmland, that decision is conclusive.  
5. **Formal Expression**  
   * The decision must be formally expressed in writing and signed by judge.  
6. **May be Preliminary or Final**  
   * A decree may be preliminary, final, or partly preliminary and partly final.

**Difference between Preliminary and Final Decree**

1. **Preliminary Decree**  
   * A preliminary decree decides rights of parties but does not completely dispose of the suit. Further proceedings are required before final decree.  
   * Example: In a partition suit, court declares shares of Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth. This is preliminary decree. Actual division of property will be done later.  
2. **Final Decree**  
   * A final decree completely disposes of the suit and conclusively determines rights of parties.  
   * Example: After partition shares are declared, commissioner divides property and court passes final decree allotting specific portions to Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth.  
3. **Nature**  
   * Preliminary decree is not executable; final decree is executable.  
   * Example: Declaration of shares cannot be enforced until final decree is passed.  
4. **Stages**  
   * Preliminary decree is passed at intermediate stage; final decree at conclusion.  
5. **Examples in CPC**  
   * Partition suits, mortgage suits, and administration suits often involve preliminary and final decrees.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek, Krishna, and Raghavendra jointly own ancestral house in Lucknow.

* Court declares Prateek has 40%, Krishna 30%, Raghavendra 30%. This is **preliminary decree**.  
* Later, commissioner divides house into portions and court passes decree allotting specific rooms to each. This is **final decree**.

**Conclusion**  

A decree is the formal adjudication conclusively determining rights of parties in a suit. Its essentials include adjudication, institution of suit, determination of rights, conclusiveness, and formal expression. Decrees may be preliminary or final. Preliminary decree declares rights but requires further proceedings, while final decree conclusively disposes of suit and is executable. Understanding this distinction is crucial for civil procedure.

## Q2. What do you understand about the doctrine of Res Judicata? Discuss the essential conditions for the application of this doctrine.

**Doctrine of Res Judicata**

**Meaning**  

The doctrine of *Res Judicata* is contained in **Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**. It means “a matter once decided cannot be re‑agitated.” In simple words, if a competent court has already decided a dispute between parties, the same issue cannot be raised again in another suit.

For example, if Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow court claiming ownership of farmland and the court decides in favor of Prateek, Krishna cannot file another suit in Kanpur court on the same ownership issue.

**Object of the Doctrine**

* To prevent multiplicity of suits.  
* To protect parties from harassment.  
* To uphold finality of judicial decisions.  
* To save judicial time.

**Essential Conditions for Application of Res Judicata**

1. **Matter Directly and Substantially in Issue**  
   * The matter in the subsequent suit must be directly and substantially the same as in the former suit.  
   * Example: Raghavendra sues Laukendra for possession of house in Kanpur. Later, Laukendra sues Raghavendra for same house. The issue is identical.  
2. **Same Parties or Parties Claiming Under Them**  
   * The parties in both suits must be the same or claiming under the same title.  
   * Example: Saurabh sues Satyam for recovery of loan. Later, Sachkeerat (legal heir of Satyam) sues Saurabh on same issue. Res Judicata applies.  
3. **Same Title in Both Suits**  
   * Parties must litigate under same title.  
   * Example: Krishna sues Prateek as landlord for rent. Later, Krishna sues Prateek as tenant for same rent. Different titles—Res Judicata does not apply.  
4. **Matter Heard and Finally Decided**  
   * The matter must have been heard and finally decided by the court.  
   * Example: If Kanishth’s suit is dismissed for default, it is not Res Judicata because issue was not decided.  
5. **Court of Competent Jurisdiction**  
   * The former suit must have been decided by a court competent to try the subsequent suit.  
   * Example: If a small causes court decides a rent dispute, its decision binds parties in later suits.  
6. **Former Suit**  
   * The suit which was decided earlier is the former suit; the later one is the subsequent suit.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow claiming ownership of farmland. Court decides in favor of Prateek. Later, Krishna files another suit in Kanpur claiming same farmland.

* Issue is directly and substantially same.  
* Parties are same.  
* Title is same (ownership).  
* Matter was finally decided.

Court was competent.

* Thus, Res Judicata applies and second suit is barred.

**Case Laws**

* **Sheoparsan Singh v. Ramnandan Prasad (1916)**: Privy Council held that once matter is decided, it cannot be reopened.  
* **Satyadhyan Ghosal v. Deorajin Debi (1960)**: Supreme Court held Res Judicata applies even to interlocutory orders.  
* **Daryao v. State of U.P. (1961)**: Supreme Court held Res Judicata applies even to writ petitions.

**Conclusion**  

The doctrine of Res Judicata ensures finality of litigation and prevents harassment through repeated suits. Its essential conditions include same matter, same parties, same title, final decision, and competent court. By applying this doctrine, courts uphold justice and efficiency, ensuring that one dispute is decided once and for all.

## Q3. Discuss the suits of a civil nature under Civil Procedure Code with the help of suitable examples.

**Suits of a Civil Nature under CPC**

**Meaning**  

Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) provides that civil courts have jurisdiction to try all suits of a *civil nature* unless barred. A suit of civil nature is one where the principal question relates to determination of civil rights such as property, office, or status.

Civil nature does not mean only property disputes—it includes all matters where rights of individuals are affected.

**Examples of Suits of Civil Nature**

1. **Property Disputes**  
   * Example: Prateek sues Krishna for ownership of farmland in Lucknow. This is a civil suit because it involves property rights.  
2. **Right to Office**  
   * Example: Raghavendra claims right to be trustee of a temple in Kanpur. Laukendra disputes it. Suit is of civil nature because it involves right to office.  
3. **Right to Worship**  
   * Example: Saurabh is prevented by Satyam from entering a temple in Faizabad. He files suit claiming right to worship. This is civil nature.  
4. **Right to Franchise**  
   * Example: Sachkeerat is denied membership in a cooperative society in Lucknow. He sues for recognition of his right. This is civil nature.  
5. **Right to Maintenance**  
   * Example: Kanishth sues for maintenance from family property. This is civil nature.

**Matters Not of Civil Nature**

Civil courts do not entertain suits involving:

* Purely political questions.  
* Religious rituals not affecting civil rights.  
* Example: If Krishna sues Prateek over method of performing puja without affecting property or office, it is not civil nature.

**Principle**  

The test is whether the principal question relates to civil rights. If yes, suit is of civil nature. If it relates only to religious ceremonies or political matters, it is not.

**Illustrative Example**    
Suppose Prateek sues Krishna claiming ownership of ancestral house in Lucknow. This is civil nature.  
If Raghavendra sues Laukendra claiming right to perform a particular ritual in temple without affecting property or office, this is not civil nature.

If Saurabh sues Satyam for right to worship in temple, this is civil nature because it affects civil right of worship.

**Judicial Approach**  

Courts interpret “civil nature” broadly to include all rights of property, office, status, and worship. The aim is to ensure that individuals can seek remedy for violation of civil rights.

**Conclusion**  

Suits of civil nature under CPC include disputes relating to property, office, status, maintenance, and worship. The guiding principle is whether the matter affects civil rights. Political or purely religious rituals are excluded. Thus, Section 9 ensures that civil courts provide remedy for all matters where civil rights are at stake.

## Q4. Discuss in brief the place of suing under the Code of Civil Procedure.

**Place of Suing under CPC**

**Meaning**  

The “place of suing” refers to the court in which a civil suit must be instituted. The rules are provided under **Sections 15 to 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**. These provisions ensure that suits are filed in the proper court based on jurisdiction—pecuniary, territorial, and subject matter.

**General Principles**

1. **Section 15 – Pecuniary Jurisdiction**  
   * Every suit must be filed in the lowest grade court competent to try it.  
   * Example: If Prateek sues Krishna for recovery of ₹50,000, the suit must be filed in the Munsif Court at Lucknow, not directly in the District Court.  
2. **Section 16 – Suits Relating to Immovable Property**  
   * Suits concerning immovable property must be filed in the court within whose jurisdiction the property is situated.  
   * Example: Raghavendra sues Laukendra for possession of land in Kanpur. Suit must be filed in Kanpur court, not in Faizabad.  
3. **Section 17 – Immovable Property in Different Jurisdictions**  
   * If property is situated in areas under different courts, suit may be filed in any court within whose jurisdiction part of property is located, provided that court is competent.  
   * Example: Saurabh owns land partly in Lucknow and partly in Faizabad. He sues Satyam for possession. Suit can be filed in Lucknow or Faizabad court.  
4. **Section 18 – Uncertain Jurisdiction**  
   * If there is uncertainty about jurisdiction, plaintiff may file suit in any court, and decision will be valid.  
5. **Section 19 – Suits for Compensation for Wrong Done to Person or Movables**  
   * Suit may be filed where wrong was done or where defendant resides.  
   * Example: Sachkeerat is assaulted by Krishna in Lucknow. He may sue in Lucknow (where wrong occurred) or Kanpur (where Krishna resides).  
6. **Section 20 – Other Suits**  
   * Suits may be filed where defendant resides, carries on business, or where cause of action arises.  
   * Example: Kanishth sues Prateek for breach of contract signed in Faizabad. Suit may be filed in Faizabad (where cause of action arose) or Lucknow (where Prateek resides).

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek, resident of Lucknow, sues Krishna, resident of Kanpur, for recovery of ₹2 lakh borrowed in Faizabad.

* Pecuniary jurisdiction: Suit must be filed in court competent to try suits of ₹2 lakh.

Territorial jurisdiction: Suit may be filed in Lucknow (plaintiff’s residence), Kanpur (defendant’s residence), or Faizabad (where cause of action arose).

* Thus, plaintiff has choice of forum.

**Importance of Place of Suing**

* Prevents harassment of defendants by forcing them to defend suits in distant courts.  
* Ensures convenience and fairness.  
* Provides certainty in law.  
* Saves judicial time.

**Conclusion**  

The CPC lays down clear rules for place of suing based on pecuniary, territorial, and cause of action considerations. Suits relating to immovable property must be filed where property is situated, suits for wrongs where wrong occurred or defendant resides, and other suits where defendant resides or cause of action arises. These rules ensure fairness, convenience, and proper administration of justice.

## Q5. What do you mean by pleadings? Explain the different rules of pleadings.

**Meaning of Pleadings**

Pleadings are the written statements filed by parties in a civil suit, setting out their claims and defenses. They consist of the **plaint** (filed by plaintiff) and the **written statement** (filed by defendant). Pleadings are governed by **Order VI CPC**.

The object of pleadings is to inform each party of the case they have to meet, to bring parties to definite issues, and to avoid surprises during trial.

For example, if Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow for recovery of ₹1,00,000 loan, his plaint must clearly state facts of loan, date, and non‑payment. Krishna’s written statement must state his defense, such as repayment or denial of loan.

**Rules of Pleadings**

The CPC lays down several important rules to ensure clarity and fairness:

1. **Pleadings Must State Material Facts, Not Evidence (Order VI Rule 2\)**  
   * Only essential facts must be stated, not detailed evidence.  
   * Example: Raghavendra’s plaint should state that Laukendra trespassed on his land in Kanpur, not the names of all witnesses who saw it.  
2. **No Law, Only Facts**  
   * Pleadings should not contain legal arguments or conclusions of law.  
   * Example: Saurabh should state “Satyam did not repay loan,” not “Satyam is legally bound under contract law.”  
3. **Conciseness and Clarity**  
   * Pleadings must be brief, clear, and precise.  
   * Example: Sachkeerat’s plaint should simply state “Defendant borrowed ₹50,000 on 1 Jan 2020 and failed to repay.”  
4. **Consistency**  
   * Pleadings must be consistent and not contradictory.  
   * Example: Kanishth cannot claim in plaint that Krishna borrowed ₹1,00,000 and later in same plaint say ₹50,000.  
5. **Specific Denial**  
   * Defendant must specifically deny allegations; vague denial is not enough.  
   * Example: If Prateek alleges Krishna borrowed ₹1,00,000, Krishna must specifically deny or explain repayment. Saying “I deny everything” is insufficient.  
6. **Alternative Pleas Allowed**  
   * Parties may take alternative pleas if consistent.  
   * Example: Raghavendra may plead “I am owner of land; alternatively, I am tenant.”  
7. **No Scandalous or Irrelevant Matter**  
   * Pleadings must not contain abusive or irrelevant statements.  
   * Example: Laukendra cannot write “Saurabh is dishonest in all his dealings.”  
8. **Amendment of Pleadings**  
   * Court may allow amendment to serve justice, provided it does not change nature of suit.  
   * Example: Satyam may amend plaint to correct date of loan.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna for recovery of loan in Lucknow.

* His plaint states: “Defendant borrowed ₹1,00,000 on 1 Jan 2020, promised repayment by 1 Jan 2021, but failed.”

Krishna’s written statement: “Loan was repaid on 15 Dec 2020\. Plaintiff has suppressed this fact.”

* This brings parties to definite issue: whether loan was repaid.

**Importance of Rules of Pleadings**

* Prevents surprise during trial.  
* Narrows down issues for decision.  
* Saves time and expense.  
* Ensures fairness and clarity.

**Conclusion**  

Pleadings are the foundation of civil litigation. They consist of plaint and written statement, governed by rules ensuring clarity, conciseness, and focus on material facts. By following these rules, courts can frame proper issues and deliver justice efficiently.

## Q6. What do you mean by Commission? In which cases Court may issue commission? Discuss.

**Commission under CPC**

**Meaning**  

A *commission* is an order issued by a civil court under **Sections 75–78 and Order XXVI of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)** authorizing a person (called commissioner) to perform certain acts like recording evidence, inspecting property, or conducting inquiries. The purpose is to assist the court in effective adjudication when direct performance by the court is difficult or inconvenient.

For example, if Prateek files a suit against Krishna in Lucknow and a key witness lives in Kanpur and cannot travel, the court may issue a commission to record his evidence at Kanpur.

**Cases Where Court May Issue Commission**

1. **Examination of Witnesses (Order XXVI Rule 1\)**  
   * When witnesses cannot attend court due to distance, illness, or other valid reasons, commission is issued to record their evidence.  
   * Example: Raghavendra, a witness in a property dispute at Lucknow, lives in Faizabad and is bedridden. Court appoints commissioner to record his statement at Faizabad.  
2. **Local Investigation (Order XXVI Rule 9\)**  
   * Commission may be issued to inspect property or conduct local inquiry.  
   * Example: Laukendra sues Saurabh for encroachment on land in Kanpur. Court appoints commissioner to measure land and report encroachment.  
3. **Examination of Accounts (Order XXVI Rule 11\)**  
   * In suits involving complicated accounts, commissioner may be appointed to examine and prepare report.  
   * Example: Satyam and Sachkeerat are partners in a business at Lucknow. Dispute arises over profit sharing. Court appoints commissioner to check accounts.  
4. **Partition of Property (Order XXVI Rule 13\)**  
   * In partition suits, commissioner may be appointed to divide property and suggest allotments.  
   * Example: Prateek, Krishna, and Kanishth seek partition of ancestral house in Faizabad. Court appoints commissioner to divide property fairly.  
5. **Conducting Sale of Property (Order XXVI Rule 10\)**  
   * Commissioner may be appointed to sell property and distribute proceeds.  
   * Example: Raghavendra’s mortgaged property in Kanpur is ordered to be sold. Court appoints commissioner to conduct sale.  
6. **Scientific or Expert Investigation (Order XXVI Rule 10A)**  
   * In technical matters, commissioner may be appointed to conduct expert inquiry.  
   * Example: Satyam claims damage to machinery in Lucknow factory. Court appoints engineer as commissioner to inspect machinery.  
7. **Examination of Documents**  
   * Commissioner may be directed to examine documents and submit report.  
   * Example: Laukendra produces old rent receipts in dispute with Saurabh. Court appoints commissioner to verify authenticity.

**Advantages of Commission**

* Saves time and expense of court.  
* Provides accurate local or technical information.  
* Ensures justice when witnesses or evidence are inaccessible.  
* Helps court in complex matters like accounts or partition.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna for boundary dispute in Lucknow. Witnesses live in Kanpur and cannot travel. Court appoints commissioner to record their evidence at Kanpur. Commissioner also inspects disputed boundary and submits report. Based on this, court decides case effectively.

**Conclusion**  

Commission under CPC is a vital tool enabling courts to gather evidence, conduct inquiries, and resolve disputes efficiently. It ensures justice by overcoming practical difficulties like distance, illness, or technical complexity. Thus, commissions serve the purpose of assisting courts in delivering fair and complete adjudication.

## Q7. What is temporary injunction? When and in what matters temporary injunction can be granted? Discuss.

**Temporary Injunction under CPC**

**Meaning**  

A *temporary injunction* is a judicial order restraining a party from doing certain acts or directing them to perform certain acts until the final disposal of the suit. It is governed by **Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**. The purpose is to preserve the subject matter of the suit and prevent irreparable harm before the court gives its final decision.

For example, if Prateek files a suit against Krishna in Lucknow claiming ownership of farmland and Krishna starts construction on it, the court may grant a temporary injunction restraining Krishna until the case is decided.

**When Temporary Injunction Can Be Granted**

1. **When Property is in Danger of Being Wasted or Alienated (Order XXXIX Rule 1\)**  
   * If property in dispute is in danger of being wasted, damaged, or alienated by defendant, injunction can be granted.  
   * Example: Raghavendra sues Laukendra for possession of house in Kanpur. Laukendra tries to sell house during pendency of suit. Court may restrain him.  
2. **When Defendant Threatens to Remove or Dispose of Property**  
   * If defendant threatens to remove property to defeat plaintiff’s claim, injunction may be granted.  
   * Example: Saurabh sues Satyam for recovery of goods stored in Faizabad. Satyam threatens to move goods to another city. Court may restrain him.  
3. **When Defendant Threatens to Injure Plaintiff’s Rights**  
   * If defendant threatens to invade plaintiff’s rights, injunction may be granted.  
   * Example: Sachkeerat sues Krishna for right of way over land in Lucknow. Krishna threatens to block path. Court may restrain him.  
4. **When Breach of Contract is Threatened (Order XXXIX Rule 2\)**  
   * If defendant threatens to breach contract, injunction may be granted.  
   * Example: Kanishth contracts with Prateek to supply goods. Prateek threatens to sell goods to another. Court may restrain him.  
5. **When Repetition of Wrong is Threatened**  
   * If defendant threatens to repeat wrongful act, injunction may be granted.  
   * Example: Raghavendra sues Laukendra for trespass. Laukendra threatens to trespass again. Court may restrain him.

**Matters in Which Temporary Injunction Can Be Granted**

* **Property Disputes**: To prevent alienation, waste, or damage.  
* **Contractual Disputes**: To prevent breach of contract.  
* **Rights of Way or Easement**: To prevent obstruction.  
* **Intellectual Property**: To prevent infringement of copyright or trademark.  
* **Family Disputes**: To preserve property during partition.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna claiming ownership of farmland in Lucknow. Krishna starts construction of a factory.

* Property is in danger of being altered.  
* Plaintiff’s rights are threatened.

Harm cannot be compensated by money.

* Court grants temporary injunction restraining Krishna from construction until case is decided.

**Principles Applied by Court**  

Courts apply the **Triple Test** before granting injunction:

1. Prima facie case.  
2. Balance of convenience.  
3. Irreparable injury.

If all three are satisfied, injunction is granted.

**Conclusion**  

Temporary injunction is an equitable remedy to preserve subject matter of suit and prevent irreparable harm. It is granted when property is in danger, rights are threatened, or breach of contract is imminent. Courts apply the triple test to ensure fairness. Thus, temporary injunction protects parties until final adjudication.

## Q8. Write short notes on any two of the following:

(a) Receiver  
(b) Security of costs  
(c) Arrest before judgment  
**(a) Receiver**  

A *receiver* is an impartial person appointed by the court under **Order XL CPC** to take custody and manage property during litigation. The purpose is to preserve property and prevent misuse until final decision.

* **When Appointed**:  
  * When property is in danger of being wasted, damaged, or misused.  
  * When parties are fighting over ownership or management.  
* **Powers of Receiver**:  
  * To collect rents and profits.  
  * To manage property.  
  * To protect property from damage.  
* **Example**: Prateek and Krishna dispute ownership of a shop in Lucknow. To prevent either from misusing it, court appoints Raghavendra as receiver to manage shop until case is decided.  
* **Effect**: Receiver acts as officer of court, not as agent of parties. His acts are binding.

**Conclusion**: Appointment of receiver ensures property is preserved and justice is not defeated by misuse during litigation.

**(b) Security of Costs**  

Security of costs means requiring a party to deposit money or security to cover costs of litigation. It is governed by **Order XXV CPC**.

* **When Ordered**:  
  * When plaintiff resides outside India.  
  * When plaintiff has no sufficient property within jurisdiction.  
* **Purpose**:  
  * To protect defendant from frivolous suits.  
  * To ensure defendant can recover costs if suit fails.  
* **Example**: Laukendra, living abroad, sues Saurabh in Kanpur. Court may order Laukendra to deposit security for costs so that Saurabh is protected if suit is dismissed.

**Conclusion**: Security of costs prevents harassment through frivolous suits and ensures fairness to defendants.

**(c) Arrest before Judgment**  

Arrest before judgment is provided under **Order XXXVIII Rule 1 CPC**. It allows court to arrest defendant before judgment if there is risk he may abscond or obstruct execution of decree.

* **Conditions**:  
  * Defendant intends to delay or defeat plaintiff.  
  * Defendant is about to leave jurisdiction.  
* **Procedure**:  
  * Plaintiff applies with affidavit.  
  * Court may order arrest or demand security.  
* **Example**: Satyam sues Sachkeerat for recovery of ₹1,00,000. Court finds Sachkeerat is planning to leave India to avoid decree. Court may order arrest before judgment.

**Conclusion**: Arrest before judgment is a preventive measure ensuring defendant does not escape liability and justice is secured.

## Q9. What do you mean by indigent suit? State the procedure for filing an indigent suit?

**Indigent Suit under CPC**

**Meaning**  

An *indigent suit* is a suit filed by a person who does not have sufficient means to pay the prescribed court fee. The law ensures that poverty does not prevent access to justice. Such suits are governed by **Order XXXIII of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**.

A person is considered indigent if:

* He does not possess sufficient means to pay court fee.  
* His property, excluding necessary wearing apparel and tools of livelihood, is insufficient to pay fee.

For example, if Prateek, a poor farmer in Lucknow, wants to sue Krishna for recovery of land but cannot afford court fee, he may file an indigent suit.

**Procedure for Filing Indigent Suit**

1. **Application to Court**  
   * Plaintiff must file application stating that he is indigent and cannot pay court fee.  
   * Application must include plaint with details of claim.  
   * Example: Raghavendra files application in Kanpur court stating he cannot pay fee for property suit against Laukendra.  
2. **Contents of Application**  
   * Schedule of applicant’s property with estimated value.  
   * Statement that applicant is indigent.  
   * Example: Saurabh lists his small hut and tools worth ₹5,000 in application against Satyam.  
3. **Inquiry into Indigency**  
   * Court conducts inquiry to verify applicant’s financial condition.  
   * May examine applicant or direct chief ministerial officer to inquire.  
   * Example: Sachkeerat applies in Lucknow court. Court officer visits his house to check assets.  
4. **Notice to Opposite Party and Government Pleader**  
   * Court issues notice to defendant and government pleader.  
   * They may contest claim of indigency.  
   * Example: Krishna contests Prateek’s claim, saying he owns hidden property.  
5. **Court’s Decision**  
   * If court finds applicant indigent, it allows suit to proceed without fee.  
   * If not, applicant must pay fee within time fixed.  
6. **Rejection of Application**  
   * Application may be rejected if:  
     * Applicant is not indigent.  
     * Suit is barred by law.  
     * Applicant disposed property fraudulently to appear indigent.  
   * Example: Kanishth sells land to relative to avoid fee. Court rejects application.  
7. **Conversion into Ordinary Suit**  
   * If indigent plaintiff later acquires means, he must pay court fee.  
   * Example: Laukendra wins lottery during pendency of suit. Court directs him to pay fee.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Prateek, a poor farmer in Lucknow, sues Krishna for recovery of land worth ₹2 lakh. Court fee is ₹10,000, which Prateek cannot afford.

* He files application under Order XXXIII CPC with plaint and schedule of property.  
* Court inquires into his financial condition.  
* Government pleader and Krishna are given notice.  
* Court finds Prateek indigent and allows suit without fee.  
* Suit proceeds like ordinary suit, but Prateek is exempted from fee.

**Importance of Indigent Suits**

* Ensures access to justice for poor.  
* Prevents denial of rights due to poverty.  
* Balances fairness by allowing inquiry into indigency.

**Conclusion**  

An indigent suit under CPC allows poor persons to seek justice without paying court fee. The procedure involves application, inquiry, notice, and court’s decision. If indigency is proved, suit proceeds like ordinary suit. This provision reflects principle of equality before law, ensuring that justice is not denied due to financial hardship.

## Q10. What is an interpleader suit? When and by whom can it be filed? Discuss.

**Interpleader Suit under CPC**

**Meaning**  

An *interpleader suit* is a special type of suit under **Section 88 and Order XXXV of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**. It is filed by a person who holds property or money but does not claim any right over it, while two or more other persons claim adverse rights. The purpose is to protect the stakeholder from multiple liabilities and to let the court decide who is the rightful claimant.

For example, if Prateek owes money to Krishna and Raghavendra, but both claim the same amount from him, Prateek may file an interpleader suit so the court decides who is entitled.

**When Can It Be Filed?**

1. **Existence of Rival Claims**  
   * There must be two or more persons making adverse claims over the same property or money.  
   * Example: Laukendra and Saurabh both claim ownership of ancestral house in Kanpur. Tenant Satyam, who pays rent, is confused whom to pay. He may file interpleader suit.  
2. **Stakeholder Has No Interest**  
   * The person filing suit must be a neutral stakeholder with no personal interest in property.  
   * Example: Sachkeerat holds ₹1,00,000 deposit. Both Krishna and Kanishth claim it. Sachkeerat has no interest and files interpleader suit.  
3. **Plaintiff Ready to Deliver Property**  
   * Plaintiff must be willing to deliver property or money to rightful claimant.  
   * Example: Satyam is ready to pay rent but wants court to decide whether Laukendra or Raghavendra is landlord.  
4. **No Independent Claim by Plaintiff**  
   * Plaintiff cannot claim any right over property himself.  
   * Example: If Prateek himself claims ownership of land, he cannot file interpleader suit.

**By Whom Can It Be Filed?**

* **Stakeholder or Neutral Holder**:  
  * Tenant holding rent but confused about landlord.  
  * Banker holding deposit claimed by two persons.  
  * Trustee holding property claimed by rival beneficiaries.  
* **Example**:  
  * Saurabh is tenant of house in Lucknow. Both Krishna and Raghavendra claim to be landlord. Saurabh files interpleader suit to avoid double payment.

**Procedure of Interpleader Suit (Order XXXV CPC)**

1. **Plaint**  
   * Plaintiff states he has no interest in property except charges or costs.  
   * States rival claims of defendants.  
   * Offers to deliver property to rightful claimant.  
2. **Court’s Role**  
   * Court decides which defendant has better claim.  
   * Court may order plaintiff to deposit property or money in court.  
3. **Decree**  
   * Court passes decree declaring rightful claimant.  
   * Plaintiff is discharged from liability.

**Illustrative Example**  

Suppose Sachkeerat is tenant of house in Faizabad. Both Prateek and Krishna claim to be landlord. Sachkeerat is confused whom to pay rent.

* He files interpleader suit under Section 88 CPC.  
* Court examines documents of ownership.  
* Court declares Prateek as rightful landlord.  
* Sachkeerat pays rent to Prateek and is discharged from liability.

**Importance of Interpleader Suit**

* Protects innocent stakeholder from double liability.  
* Prevents multiplicity of suits.  
* Ensures rightful claimant gets property.  
* Promotes fairness and efficiency.

**Conclusion**  

An interpleader suit is a protective remedy for neutral stakeholders facing rival claims. It can be filed when two or more persons claim the same property or money, and the stakeholder has no personal interest. The court decides rightful claimant, discharges plaintiff, and prevents double liability. Thus, interpleader suits uphold justice and efficiency in civil procedure.

* **Meaning:** The bundle of essential facts which, if proved, entitles the plaintiff to judicial relief; it is the foundation of the suit.  
* **Features:**  
  * **Material facts only:** Not evidence; the facts constituting the right and the breach.  
  * **Must be pleaded:** Order VII requires stating the cause of action and the date(s) it arose.  
* **Jurisdictional role:** Determines territorial jurisdiction under Section 20 CPC (where cause of action arises wholly or in part).  
* **Example:** Loan advanced on a specific date, promise to repay, and default—these facts together form the cause of action for recovery.  
* **Importance:** Without a disclosed cause of action, the plaint can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a).

### (j) Res‑subjudice

* **Meaning:** Under Section 10 CPC, if a previously instituted suit is pending in a competent court involving the same matter in issue between the same parties, trial of a subsequent suit must be stayed.  
* **Conditions:**  
  * **Previously instituted suit** pending.  
  * **Same parties (or parties litigating under same title).**  
  * **Same directly and substantially in‑issue matter.**  
  * **Competent court** to grant the relief in the earlier suit.  
* **Effect:** The later suit’s trial is stayed to avoid conflicting decisions; the suit is not dismissed.  
* **Example:** If Prateek’s title suit against Krishna over the Lucknow plot is already pending, a second title suit between them on the same plot filed later must be stayed.  
* **Objective:** Prevent multiplicity, inconsistent decrees, and judicial waste.

## Q2. What are the essential contents of a Decree? Whether the following orders are Decree? Explain with case laws:

(a) Award passed under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996  
(b) Final order passed in original petition  
(c) A Compromise Decree.

**Essential contents of a Decree**  

A decree is defined under Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). It is the formal expression of an adjudication by a civil court which conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit. The essentials are:

1. **Adjudication** – There must be a judicial determination of rights.  
2. **By a Civil Court** – It must be passed by a court having civil jurisdiction.  
3. **Determination of Rights** – It must conclusively decide the rights of parties.  
4. **Matters in Controversy** – It must relate to issues raised in the suit.  
5. **Formal Expression** – It must be formally recorded.  
6. **Types** – It may be preliminary, final, or partly preliminary and partly final.

Example: If Prateek sues Krishna for possession of land in Lucknow, and the court finally decides that Krishna must hand over possession, that decision is a decree.

### (a) Award passed under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996  

An arbitral award is not a decree by itself. But once the court passes an order making the award enforceable under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, it becomes executable as a decree.

* Case law: *Satish Kumar v. Surinder Kumar* (SC) held that an award becomes enforceable like a decree once it is made rule of court.  
* Example: Kanishth and Raghavendra submit their dispute to arbitration in Allahabad. Arbitrator gives award. Until court confirms it, it is not a decree. Once confirmed, it is treated as decree.

### (b) Final order passed in original petition  

If the petition is filed under CPC and the court finally adjudicates rights of parties, it is a decree.

* Case law: *Chandrika v. Bhaiyalal* held that final orders in original petitions are decrees if they conclusively determine rights.  
* Example: Laukendra files an original petition for restitution of conjugal rights in Lucknow. Court finally decides in his favour. That order is a decree.

### (c) Compromise Decree  

When parties agree to settle and court passes a decree in terms of compromise, it is a decree. Section 2(2) CPC expressly includes compromise decrees.

* Case law: *Banwari Lal v. Chando Devi* (SC) held compromise decree is valid decree.  
* Example: Satyam and Sachkeerat compromise in a property dispute at Faizabad. Court records compromise. This is a decree.

**Conclusion**  

A decree must conclusively determine rights of parties in a civil suit. Arbitration award is not decree until made rule of court, final order in original petition is decree, and compromise decree is decree by definition.

## Q3. "One suit and one decision is enough for any single dispute." Is it a rule of convenience or absolute justice ? Explain.

**Introduction**  

The statement refers to the principle of *res judicata* under Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). It means that once a matter has been finally decided between the same parties by a competent court, it cannot be reopened in another suit. This principle ensures that there is finality in litigation. The question is whether this principle is only a rule of convenience or whether it is a rule of absolute justice.

**Meaning of Res Judicata**  

Res judicata literally means “a matter already judged.” It prevents parties from filing repeated suits on the same issue.

* Example: Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow claiming ownership of a house. The court decides that Krishna is the owner. Later, Prateek cannot file another suit against Krishna on the same issue of ownership.  
* This saves time, prevents harassment, and ensures stability in legal rights.

**Rule of Convenience**  

At first glance, res judicata looks like a rule of convenience because it avoids multiple suits and saves judicial time. Courts cannot waste resources on the same dispute again and again.

* Example: If Kanishth sues Raghavendra for recovery of ₹50,000 loan in Allahabad, and the court decides, it would be inconvenient to allow Kanishth to file another suit for the same loan.  
* Thus, it is convenient for courts and parties.

**Rule of Absolute Justice**  

However, the deeper purpose of res judicata is not just convenience. It is based on public policy and justice. Justice requires that disputes must come to an end. Endless litigation would cause uncertainty and harassment.

* Case law: *Daryao v. State of UP* (SC) held that res judicata is a rule of public policy, not just convenience. It ensures finality of decisions and protects parties from repeated harassment.  
* Example: Laukendra sues Satyam for possession of land in Jaunpur. Court decides in favour of Satyam. If Laukendra is allowed to file another suit, Satyam would face endless harassment. Justice demands that one decision must be final.

**Balance of Convenience and Justice**  

Res judicata serves both purposes:

1. Convenience – avoids multiplicity of suits.  
2. Justice – ensures finality and protects parties.

But the stronger reason is justice. Convenience is secondary. The principle is absolute because it binds even higher courts. Once decided, even Supreme Court will not reopen the same issue between same parties.

**Exceptions**  

There are limited exceptions where res judicata does not apply:

* When the earlier decision was without jurisdiction.  
* When the matter was not directly in issue.

When circumstances have changed.

* Example: Sachkeerat sues Saurabh for trespass in Faizabad. Court dismisses suit because land was not proved. Later, Sachkeerat acquires ownership documents. He may file fresh suit because circumstances changed.

**Conclusion**  

The principle “one suit and one decision is enough for any single dispute” is not merely a rule of convenience. It is a rule of absolute justice based on public policy. It ensures finality of litigation, prevents harassment, and upholds certainty in law. Convenience is only a by‑product. Justice is the real foundation.

## Q4. "The object of pleading is to bring the parties to a suit on definite issues." Explain. Why must pleading state only the material facts and not the law?

**Introduction**  

Pleadings are the written statements filed by parties in a civil suit—plaint by the plaintiff and written statement by the defendant. The main purpose of pleadings is to define the scope of the dispute and to inform each party of the case they have to meet.

**Object of Pleadings**

1. **Clarity of Issues** – Pleadings help the court understand what the dispute is about.  
2. **Avoid Surprise** – Each party knows the case of the other, so no one is taken by surprise.  
3. **Framing of Issues** – Based on pleadings, the court frames issues for trial.  
4. **Efficient Trial** – Pleadings save time by narrowing down the controversy.

**Example**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow claiming that Krishna trespassed on his land. Prateek must plead facts like ownership of land, date of trespass, and damages. Krishna, in his written statement, may plead that he is the rightful owner. This helps the court frame the issue: “Who is the owner of the land?” Without pleadings, the court would be confused.

**Case Law**

* *Ganesh Trading Co. v. Moji Ram* (SC) held that pleadings must contain material facts so that parties know the case they have to meet.  
* *Bhagwati Prasad v. Chandramaul* emphasized that pleadings bring parties to definite issues.

**Conclusion**  

The object of pleadings is to bring clarity, avoid surprise, and help the court frame issues. They ensure that the trial is fair and efficient.

**Question 4(ii): Why pleading must state only the material facts and not the law?**

**Introduction**  

Order VI Rule 2 CPC states that pleadings must contain material facts, not law. Material facts are those necessary to establish a cause of action or defence.

**Reason**

1. **Duty of Parties** – Parties must present facts.  
2. **Duty of Court** – Court applies law to facts.  
3. **Avoid Confusion** – If parties plead law, it may mislead or complicate.  
4. **Uniformity** – Facts are unique to each case, law is common and presumed to be known by court.

**Example**  

Suppose Kanishth sues Raghavendra in Allahabad for recovery of loan. He must plead: “I gave ₹50,000 loan on 1st January, repayable on 1st March, not repaid.” He need not plead: “Under Contract Act, non‑payment is breach.” The court knows the law and will apply it.

**Case Law**

* *Virendra Kashinath v. Vinayak N. Joshi* held pleadings must contain facts, not law.  
* *Udhav Singh v. Madhav Rao Scindia* emphasized that material facts are essential, law is for court.

**Conclusion**  

Pleadings must state only material facts because facts are the foundation of the case. Law is applied by the court. This division ensures clarity and fairness.

## Q5. Discuss in detail the provisions relating to place of suing:

'A' , a resident of Kanpur, publishes a defamatory article at Jaunpur on 'B' a resident of Lucknow. The article was written and printed at Faizabad. 'B' wants to file a suit for damages against 'A'. Decide the place of filing the suit.

**Introduction**  

The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) lays down rules about where a civil suit can be filed. These rules are important because they prevent harassment of defendants and ensure that suits are filed in proper courts. The provisions relating to place of suing are found in Sections 15 to 20 of CPC. They deal with jurisdiction based on subject matter, pecuniary value, and territorial limits.

**General Provisions**

**Section 15 – Court of lowest grade**    
Every suit must be filed in the court of lowest grade competent to try it.

1. Example: If Prateek wants to sue Krishna for ₹50,000, he must file in Munsif Court if it has pecuniary jurisdiction, not directly in District Court.

**Section 16 – Immovable property**    
Suits relating to immovable property must be filed where the property is situated.

2. Example: If Kanishth sues Raghavendra for possession of land in Allahabad, suit must be filed in Allahabad court.

**Section 17 – Immovable property in different jurisdictions**  

3. If property is in different jurisdictions, suit may be filed in any court where part of property is situated.

**Section 18 – Uncertain jurisdiction**  

4. If it is uncertain in which jurisdiction property lies, suit may be filed in any court having jurisdiction.

**Section 19 – Wrong done to person or movable property**  

5. In cases of wrongs like defamation, suit may be filed either:  
* Where wrong was done, or  
* Where the defendant resides.  
  Example: If Satyam publishes a defamatory article against Sachkeerat in Lucknow, Sachkeerat can sue either where publication occurred or where Satyam resides.

**Section 20 – Other suits**  

6. For other suits, they may be filed where the defendant resides, carries on business, or where cause of action arises wholly or partly.

**Application to the Given Case**  

Facts:

* A (resident of Kanpur) publishes defamatory article at Jaunpur.  
* Article written and printed at Faizabad.  
* B (resident of Lucknow) wants to sue for damages.

Analysis:

* Since this is a case of defamation, Section 19 applies.  
* B can file suit either where wrong was done (Jaunpur, where publication occurred) or where defendant resides (Kanpur).  
* Printing at Faizabad is part of cause of action, so under Section 20, suit can also be filed at Faizabad.  
* B’s residence at Lucknow does not give jurisdiction unless part of cause of action arose there. Since publication was at Jaunpur, Lucknow court has no jurisdiction.

**Case Law**

* *Abdul Kadir v. State of UP* held that defamation suits can be filed where publication occurs.  
* *Bhagwan Das v. State of UP* emphasized that cause of action arises where defamatory material is published.

**Example for clarity**  

Suppose Laukendra, living in Lucknow, is defamed by Raghavendra in a newspaper published at Allahabad. Laukendra can sue at Allahabad (publication place) or at Kanpur (if Raghavendra resides there). He cannot sue at Lucknow just because he lives there.

**Conclusion**  

In the given case, B can file suit at:

* **Kanpur** (where A resides),  
* **Jaunpur** (where publication occurred),

**Faizabad** (where printing occurred).

* The most appropriate place is **Jaunpur**, because defamation is complete when publication occurs. Lucknow court has no jurisdiction.

## Q6. What do you mean by "Commission"? What are the powers of the court and procedure to issue commission? Discuss.

**Introduction**  

In civil procedure, courts often need help in collecting evidence or clarifying facts. Sometimes, it is not possible for the judge to personally visit a place, examine a witness, or check accounts. To deal with such situations, the CPC provides for “Commissions.” A commission is an order issued by the court directing a person (called commissioner) to perform certain acts like examining witnesses, inspecting property, or conducting local investigations, and then reporting back to the court.

**Meaning of Commission**  

A commission is a tool used by the court to assist in fact‑finding. It is not a judgment but a method to gather evidence or clarify matters.

* Example: Suppose Prateek and Krishna are fighting a case in Lucknow about the boundary of their agricultural land. The judge cannot personally visit the land. The court appoints a commissioner to inspect the land and submit a report. This is a commission.

**Provisions in CPC**  

Sections 75 to 78 and Orders 26 of CPC deal with commissions. Section 75 gives the general power to issue commissions, while Orders 26 provide detailed rules.

**Powers of the Court to Issue Commission**  

The court may issue commission for:

1. **Examination of Witnesses** – If a witness cannot attend court due to illness or distance, commissioner can record evidence.  
   * Example: Kanishth is a witness living in Delhi, but the case is in Allahabad. Court may issue commission to record his statement in Delhi.  
2. **Local Investigation** – To clarify matters like boundaries, possession, or condition of property.  
   * Example: Laukendra and Raghavendra dispute about a shop in Jaunpur. Court appoints commissioner to inspect shop and report.  
3. **Examination of Accounts** – In partnership or company disputes, commissioner can check accounts.  
   * Example: Satyam and Sachkeerat are partners in a business at Faizabad. Court appoints commissioner to examine accounts.  
4. **Partition of Property** – Commissioner can divide property among parties.  
5. **Scientific or Technical Investigation** – If matter requires expert knowledge, commissioner may be appointed.  
   * Example: Dispute about machinery in Kanpur, commissioner with technical knowledge may be appointed.  
6. **Sale of Property** – In certain cases, commissioner may be appointed to sell property.

**Procedure to Issue Commission**

1. **Application** – A party may apply for commission, or court may issue on its own.  
2. **Order of Court** – Court passes order specifying purpose of commission.  
3. **Appointment of Commissioner** – Court appoints a suitable person, often an advocate.  
4. **Execution** – Commissioner performs task, records evidence, inspects property, or examines accounts.  
5. **Report** – Commissioner submits report to court.  
6. **Objections** – Parties may file objections to report.  
7. **Decision** – Court considers report and objections, then decides case.

**Case Law**

* *K.K. Velusamy v. N. Palanisamy* (SC) held that commission is discretionary power of court to aid justice.  
* *Manohar Lal v. Seth Hira Lal* emphasized that commission is meant to assist court, not to replace judicial function.

**Advantages of Commission**

* Saves time of court.  
* Helps in accurate fact‑finding.  
* Useful when witnesses or property are far away.  
* Provides expert assistance in technical matters.

**Example for clarity**  

Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow claiming encroachment on his land. Court appoints commissioner to visit land in Faizabad, measure boundaries, and report. This helps court decide case without personally visiting.

**Conclusion**  

A commission is an important tool under CPC to assist courts in fact‑finding. Courts have wide powers to issue commissions for examination of witnesses, local investigation, accounts, partition, and technical matters. The procedure involves appointment of commissioner, execution of task, and submission of report. Commissions ensure justice by providing accurate information to the court.

## Q7. Write short notes on the following:

(a) Arrest before judgment  
(b) Temporary Injunction

**Question 7(a): Arrest before judgment**

**Introduction**  

The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) provides preventive remedies to ensure that the defendant does not defeat the rights of the plaintiff before the court passes judgment. One such remedy is “arrest before judgment,” provided under Order 38 Rule 1 CPC. The purpose is to prevent the defendant from absconding or leaving the jurisdiction of the court to avoid execution of a possible decree.

**Meaning and Purpose**  

Arrest before judgment means that the court may order the arrest of the defendant at the initial stage of the suit if there is strong reason to believe that he intends to obstruct or delay the execution of a decree by absconding.

* Example: Suppose Prateek sues Krishna in Lucknow for recovery of ₹1,00,000 loan. Krishna, knowing he may lose, plans to leave India permanently. The court may order his arrest before judgment to ensure he remains available for execution of decree.

**Conditions**

* Plaintiff must apply with affidavit showing defendant’s intention to abscond.  
* Court must be satisfied that defendant is about to leave jurisdiction or dispose of property to defeat decree.  
* Defendant may be released if he furnishes security.

**Case Law**

* *Raman Tech & Process Engg. Co. v. Solanki Traders* (SC) held that arrest before judgment is an extraordinary remedy and should be used sparingly.

**Conclusion**  

Arrest before judgment is a preventive measure to secure justice. It ensures that the defendant does not escape liability by absconding, but courts must use it cautiously.

**Question 7(b): Temporary Injunction**

**Introduction**  

Temporary injunction is another preventive remedy under Order 39 CPC. It is an order of the court restraining a party from doing certain acts until the suit is finally decided. The purpose is to preserve the subject matter of the suit and maintain status quo.

**Meaning and Purpose**  

Temporary injunction prevents irreparable harm and ensures that the final decree is not rendered useless.

* Example: Suppose Satyam sues Sachkeerat in Faizabad claiming ownership of a house. Sachkeerat plans to sell the house before case is decided. Court may grant temporary injunction restraining sale until judgment.

**Conditions for Granting**

* Prima facie case in favour of plaintiff.  
* Balance of convenience in favour of plaintiff.  
* Irreparable injury if injunction is not granted.

**Case Law**

* *Dalpat Kumar v. Prahlad Singh* (SC) held that injunction can be granted only if all three conditions are satisfied.  
* *Gujarat Bottling Co. v. Coca Cola Co.* emphasized that injunction maintains status quo.

**Conclusion**  

Temporary injunction is a vital remedy to protect rights during litigation. It ensures that the subject matter is preserved and justice is not defeated by premature actions of parties.

## Q8. Suit against the government cannot be filed without notice. Explain relevant provisions of C.P.C.

**Introduction**  

The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) contains special provisions for filing suits against the government or public officers. The law recognizes that the government performs important functions and should not be dragged into litigation without being given a chance to resolve disputes. Therefore, Section 80 CPC makes it mandatory to serve a notice before filing a suit against the government or a public officer.

**Section 80 CPC – Mandatory Notice**  

Section 80(1) CPC states that no suit shall be instituted against the government or a public officer in respect of any act done in official capacity until the plaintiff has served a notice in writing two months prior to filing the suit.

**Contents of Notice**  

The notice must contain:

1. Name, description, and residence of the plaintiff.  
2. Cause of action.  
3. Relief claimed.  
4. Name of defendant (government or officer).

The notice must be delivered to:

* Secretary of the government (if suing Union Government).  
* Collector or other officer (if suing State Government).  
* Public officer concerned (if suing officer personally).

**Purpose of Notice**

1. To give the government an opportunity to settle disputes without litigation.  
2. To avoid unnecessary suits.  
3. To save time and expenses of courts and parties.

**Example**  

Suppose Prateek wants to sue the UP Government for wrongful acquisition of his land in Lucknow. He must first serve a two‑month notice to the Collector stating his grievance and relief sought. Only after two months can he file suit.

**Exceptions under Section 80(2)**  

In urgent cases, where immediate relief is required, the court may allow filing of suit without notice, but only with its permission.

* Example: Krishna’s property in Allahabad is about to be demolished by government officers. He cannot wait two months. Court may allow him to file suit immediately with leave under Section 80(2).

**Case Law**

* *Bihari Chowdhary v. State of Bihar* (SC) held that notice under Section 80 CPC is mandatory and failure to serve notice makes suit not maintainable.  
* *State of AP v. Gundugola Venkata Suryanarayana Garu* emphasized that purpose of notice is to give government chance to settle dispute.  
* *Ghanshyam Dass v. Dominion of India* clarified that technical defects in notice should not defeat justice if substantial compliance is made.

**Practical Illustration**  

Suppose Laukendra, a farmer in Jaunpur, wants to sue the government for damages caused by wrongful cancellation of his irrigation rights. He must serve notice to the Collector of Jaunpur, stating his name, cause of action, and relief. If government does not respond within two months, he can file suit. If urgent relief is needed, he may seek court’s permission to file without notice.

**Conclusion**  

Section 80 CPC makes notice mandatory before suing government or public officers. The notice must be served two months before filing suit, giving government opportunity to settle dispute. Exceptions exist for urgent cases with court’s permission. The provision balances the rights of citizens with the need to protect government from unnecessary litigation.

## Q9. What are the conditions to file an indigent suit? Describe the procedure for filing such a suit.

**Introduction**  

Justice must be accessible to all, including those who cannot afford court fees. The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) provides a special mechanism under **Order 33** for indigent persons to file suits without paying court fees at the beginning. Such suits are called “indigent suits.” The purpose is to ensure that poverty does not prevent a person from seeking justice.

**Meaning of Indigent Person**  

An indigent person is someone who does not have sufficient means to pay the prescribed court fee.

* Example: Laukendra, a poor farmer from Jaunpur, wants to sue for recovery of his land but cannot afford the court fee. He may apply to file an indigent suit.

**Conditions to File Indigent Suit**  

Order 33 Rule 1 CPC lays down conditions:

1. **Insufficient Means** – The person must not have sufficient means to pay court fee.  
2. **Property Value** – If the person owns property, its value must be less than ₹1,000 (excluding necessary wearing apparel and tools of livelihood).  
3. **No Fraud** – The application must be genuine, not filed to avoid payment fraudulently.  
4. **Cause of Action** – There must be a valid cause of action.  
5. **Not Transferred Property** – The applicant must not have transferred property to appear indigent.

**Case Law**

* *Mathai v. A. Karthikeyan* (SC) held that indigent person can sue without fee if conditions are satisfied.  
* *Union Bank of India v. Khader International* emphasized that poverty should not bar access to justice.

**Procedure for Filing Indigent Suit**  

The procedure is detailed in Order 33 CPC:

1. **Application** – Plaintiff files application to sue as indigent person. Application must include:  
   * Schedule of property owned.  
   * Statement of cause of action.  
   * Relief claimed.  
2. **Inquiry by Court** – Court conducts inquiry into applicant’s financial condition.  
   * Example: Prateek applies to file indigent suit in Lucknow. Court asks local officer to verify his property and income.  
3. **Notice to Opposite Party** – Court issues notice to defendant and government pleader to contest application.  
4. **Hearing** – Court hears applicant and considers objections.  
5. **Decision** – If court is satisfied that applicant is indigent, it allows suit without fee. If not, application is rejected.  
6. **Rejection Grounds** – Application may be rejected if:  
   * Applicant is not indigent.  
   * Cause of action is not valid.  
   * Applicant transferred property to appear indigent.  
7. **Proceeding of Suit** – Once allowed, suit proceeds like ordinary suit. Court fee is waived initially. If plaintiff later acquires means, court may order payment of fee.

**Case Law**

* *P.M. Ashwathanarayana Setty v. State of Karnataka* held that indigent suits ensure equality before law.  
* *Khatri v. State of Bihar* emphasized that access to justice is fundamental right.

**Example for clarity**  

Suppose Satyam, a daily wage worker in Faizabad, wants to sue Sachkeerat for wrongful eviction from his house. Court fee is ₹5,000, which Satyam cannot afford. He files application under Order 33 CPC with schedule of his property (only clothes and tools). Court verifies his condition, finds him indigent, and allows suit without fee.

**Conclusion**  

Indigent suits under Order 33 CPC ensure that poverty does not prevent access to justice. Conditions include insufficient means, genuine cause of action, and no fraudulent transfer of property. The procedure involves application, inquiry, notice, and court’s decision. This provision reflects the principle that justice must be available to all, rich or poor.
